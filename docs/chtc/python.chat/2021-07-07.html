<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:15)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> I just started a workspace build with the pytest_old framework and all related tests ripped out. Assuming this all goes well, any issues if I merge it into master later?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:43)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> (I still have to backport everything into stable, that comes next)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:07)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Nothing comes to mind; it sounds good to me. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:30)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Excellent :slightly_smiling_face: The test_curl_plugin failed in my workspace build but it was a known issue I forgot to fix. I'm going to merge to master.<br/>

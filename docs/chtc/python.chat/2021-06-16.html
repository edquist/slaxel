<h3>Wed Jun 16, 2021 : #python (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:41)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Does anybody know where the Windows installer for the Python bindings are?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:10)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> The manual points to the new Downloads page on the website that doesn't have any information about installing on Windows<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:48)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I believe the main Windows installer itself has an option to install (only?) the Python bindings<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:03)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Yes but where is the Windows installer? It's been scrubbed from the website.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:30)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Okay I found it from the page in the manual. I'm surprised we've hidden it so deep on the main website.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:15:55)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> ... and there doesn't seem to be a way to just install the bindings? Did I miss a sneaky option somewhere?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:05)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> There is no way to ask the Condor MSI installer to install only the python bindings<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:29)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> It will definitly bork it.  use the .zip file instead<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:38)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> ah, I thought we did that?<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:11)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> didnâ€™t we do something for Windows users that only wanted the bindings?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:54)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Maybe something like a conda install?   I don't think you get that from our website<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:54)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> Nope, I thought a couple years ago we had put together something (I thought it was an option in the installer) to only install the bindings, but I must be mistaken<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:20)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I was just in the installer, there is no way to run it without having it install condor as service<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:40)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> You can't use it to install a personal condor either.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:26)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> From <a href="http://htcondor.org/downloads">htcondor.org/downloads</a>, click once to select a channel, click once on Windows (in the left-hand menu) and click on the link in step 1?  Is the problem that there's more clicks from there to get to the actual file?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:56)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Yup. It took 2 clicks to get to a big wall of text.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:20)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> You can scold me all you want for not reading through this in detail, but nobody reads anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:27)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> And that's "hidden it so deep"?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:06)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> People keep saying that and I keep hearing "so I don't have to write webpages for people with short attention spans anymore, then."<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:25)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Because if they're not reading, it doesn't matter what I say in text.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:45:13)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Yes, people have short attention spans and nobody reads. You know that.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:51)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I can't tell if you ironically or actually missed my point.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:51:39)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I think it looks pretty good.  I noticed that it does not send you to the <tt>current</tt> link, but since it is perhaps important to explain the <tt>daily</tt> and the fact that the the latest version link will never have a <tt>release</tt> subdir, that's a reasonable judgement call.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:00)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Also the *first* link on the Windows page, sends you to the page for batch installs.  it's the second link on that page that gets you to a download.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:34)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> But if people just *read* the few lines of text, it's clear what to do.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:15)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> It should arguably always point to the specific binary release the manual was built for, but that turns out to be hard. :/<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:53)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> If it were up to me, daily and rc builds would be much harder to find.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:54)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I suppose we could move the second two paragraphs to after the "quickstart" installation instructions.  (It's a fair point about the download link not being the first one on the page.  As long as those two paragraphs get their own entry in the left-hand menu, though, I guess it should be OK.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:36)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I concur.  We spend _far_ too much time worrying about builds that should only ever be used for internal test processes.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:58:13)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> So I'm happy that it sounds like we're going to do "point release + patch" for OSG, instead.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:38)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Why are RC and daily builds published at all? I feel like these should only be made available to people on an as-needed basis.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:34)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Because ToddT wanted them published, possibly under the mistaken belief that they'd be useful to someone?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:24)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Maybe he thought it was easier on TimT to publish a daily automagically rather than have one of us tell TimT which build to add to the repo?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:50)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Because some of our customers really want to install from a repo even when testing fixes for us, for some reason.)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> at some point I'm going to make containers from the daily builds<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:26)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> which is where installing from a repo helps a lot<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:41)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Interesting.  What's the motivation?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:04)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> I agree they should be available, but not published. We already bombard our customers with so many different flavors, varieties and options.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:21)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> I know that Condor is complicated and this is inevitable to a point, but daily builds and RCs seem excessive.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:11:21)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> there's a "devops negotiator" project which is a second negotiator for the OSG pool that's going to be used for testing prerelease builds<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:40)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Won't that be better as specific builds, though?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:54)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Even if we achieve devops enlightenment and the master branch is always "ready to release", that doesn't mean we _want_ any random build.)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:54)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> this is deployed as a pod on the tiger kubernetes cluster<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:04)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> so for selecting the build, we just want to change which container tag we're using<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:26)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> We build more than once a day.  My understanding is that the container tag will reflect whichever random build was chosen by the automatic system as _the_ daily build.  That build might not be once that we want, as compared to some other build from that day.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:18:24)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> we'll build it every night at midnight or something<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:18:36)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... which might not be the build that we want.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:27)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah it's kind of an 80% solution<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:34)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> From my point of view, the useful thing to do is (or, not having experienced devops nirvana, seems to be) to (manually) select a git hash which is then built, uploaded to a repo, and in turn kicks off a container build tagged with that hash.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:07)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Eh.  It will be a problem, later, but probably for somebody else, so I'll stop griping about it now.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:27)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I agree with both of those sentences :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:32)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (OK, now I look less 90's, right?)<br/>

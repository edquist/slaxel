<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(18:53:39)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> update on Mostafaâ€™s files:<br/><pre>Each directory from our imaging instrument (representing a single 96-well plate) contains anywhere from hundreds to many thousands of individual images sorted into structured directors and associated metadata (sometimes tiled across each well, z-plane, time points, magnifications, and fluorescence filters). Each image is usually about 20 Mb and the total folder size can range from 4 gigs to 30 gigs. We currently use an smbc flag to tar up the folder as we move it from ResearchDrive to Staging and our submission scripts are structured to deliver a tar file as output with the same name (description&lt;<a href="https://www.zamanianlab.org/ZamanianLabDocs/pipelines_server/">https://www.zamanianlab.org/ZamanianLabDocs/pipelines_server/</a>&gt;). If we can get globus to 'tar' the folder on transfer to staging that would be great, but I understand if that's not possible.</pre><br/>

<h3>Thu Aug 19, 2021 : #facilitation (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:08)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I want to add the newly-added cluster features (right now, just which nodes have avx) to a user guide but am stumped as to whether I should put it under “Job Submission” or “Software on the Cluster” or create a new troubleshooting guide…<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:18)</span> <b>jbart:</b></span> As someone with a mostly outside perspective, if I was looking for help on cluster features, I'd definitely click on "Software On The Cluster" first. Doesn't necessarily mean it belongs there though.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:04)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> @ckoch5 I agree that there's definitely overlap - software and instruction sets often go together.  In this context, though, I think it'd make more sense to include under "Job Submission" because I see making use of Slurm job/node features as being part of the submission process.  The user's interface to those features is the same commands (sbatch, squeue, sacct, etc) used for other job submission tasks.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:51)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> @tjslauson that’s where I was leaning, with maybe a reference from the software page.<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:23)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> ^^ @tjslauson @lmichael let me know what you think<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Maybe a separate page (linked from 1-2 places in the Overview) that specifically covers “hardware specifications”.<br/>

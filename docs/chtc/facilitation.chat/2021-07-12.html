<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:25:02)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> ^^ this would involve giving them a bigger item quota and writing all the small files to staging. I don’t think the small files are THAT small, to be fair.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:36:27)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> :wave: good morning!  How big would the bigger item quota be here?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:48)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I would need to email Mostafa and ask for more specific numbers.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:48:24)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> If they were doing one batch of data at a time (not in parallel), they’d probably need no more than 100s (?) of files. I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:49:38)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> which is not too bad. I guess my question is - does it make sense to zip all the files if you’re going to write them to staging anyway? Like…we’ve already done the writes. Or is it better because we don’t want lots of small files over the long term?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> And this data is too large in bulk to just use /home?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:43)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:20)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> Would a good next step be for me to get exact dimensions from Mostafa (size + number of individual files, size of tarred dataset)?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yup<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:33)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt;  Or is it better because we don’t want lots of small files over the long term?<br/>I'm less worried about small files on Ceph (I mean, yes, there's a limit there...) and more thinking about management of different datasets.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Agreed. And if the files are small and only hundreds, maybe /home is fine - compress before submitting jobs, mainly for data management and reduced transfer times, if applicable.<br/>

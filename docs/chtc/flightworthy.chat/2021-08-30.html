<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:56:13)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Is GSI going away with this coming HTCondor pre-release?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:25)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @bbockelman it's going to take some time to gut GSI in CHTC.  We don't use it much for intra-CHTC security negotiation, but we do for extra-CHTC security negotiation<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:39)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> I'd imagine our physicist friends are mostly on top of it though....<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:45)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> @wiscmoate - indeed, we said this would happen October 2021 IIRC.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:16)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Alrighty<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:41)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> (so, if I back-calculate to the release, indeed it sounds like it'll happen this one or next one.  @tannenba is the guru here, of course)<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:58)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> To answer your implied question: yes, we need to work on this soon.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:29)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> We will make a decision about the next RC this afternoon. If we cut an RC today. GSI will still be there. Then the next won't have GSI and you get that within a month.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:33)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> We may delay and then whatever you get next will not have GSI.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:41)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> just to check: this is for the 9.1 series, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:53)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Just 9.1<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> continuing the versioning discussion here: I think you guys are well positioned to go with <tt>X.0.Z</tt> = stable since that fits nicely with 9.0 already<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> your users already know that dev series = potentially disruptive new features, that could include the new semantic versioning scheme<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and so it's really just a comms challenge, imo, which is perfect timing since you've got euro condor week coming up. That + the mailing lists + homepage + twitter for announcements, you just need to have the new versioning scheme written up<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and you don't need to switch over right away, you can say that you're going to start this at the beginning of the calendar year or something. But the longer you give people, the longer you're going to have to limp through abusing RCs for the OS pool deployments<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:29)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> I love the <tt>X.0.Z</tt> = stable approach.  Also like the idea of getting the comms going soon.<br/>

<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:51)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I missed something<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:13)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Big discussion in the Condor Dev meeting about changing the version number scheme for Condor<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> You have no idea how strong my urge to butt in is, but I'm resisting :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:31)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @wiscmoate We will be cutting an RC this week and it will still have GSI compiled in. However, the next one coming right on its heels will *not* have GSI. You have been warned. The release without GSI goes out by October 10th, and we have another milestone on Novemeber 10th. It looks like monthly releases for a while.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:44)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> right-o @tim, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:03)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> anybody here familiar with an error of the form <tt>DC_INVALIDATE_KEY: security session ... lifetime expired</tt> in the condor-ce SchedLog, with an IP address in the log lines referring to the CE<br/>

<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(07:50:37)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Correct.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so is the game plan to release today?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:11)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Please specify "release", to my understanding we have 2 security releases and 1 devel release about to go out?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:45)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I can be online before 11. I can finish up the security release.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:39)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I think the brown-bag security release (the second one, 9.0.4 and 9.1.2) is already in the repos and the like and ... awaits announcements and the like?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:02:20)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> The dev release goes out on Tuesday (assuming all the security-release patch(es) all merged cleanly, I guess)?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:01)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Oh.  And there's supposed to be a stable release on Monday?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:58)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Next week's releases will be pushed back a week.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:02)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Tim, I can't tell if we should drop alcohol or caffeine off at your place.<br/>

<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:32)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Luckily there is plenty of Heather's beer here.<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:13)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Ah, well, maybe neither, then. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:41)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I talked with ToddT this morning before he had to Retreat for the day. He agrees we should finish the new releases today, with a release announcement that says the previous security release had a flaw that is rectified by the new one.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:04)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Also, we should remove the previous security release from the website, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:13)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> And send an email to our security contacts with a bit of additional information about the scope of the flaw in the security release (so they can judge if they need to upgrade again immediately.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:13)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I can handle the email to the security contacts.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:38)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Tim, if you need help with the other release machinery, I can help with that, too. Just tell me what you need.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:27)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> <b>@here</b> The accomplishments text for our July NSF report is at the top of the FlightWorthy Google doc.  Please update asap, would like it done by EOB Monday.  Same as always, anything left in red should be updated or deleted.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:54)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Email to security contacts sent.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:05)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Both contacts we have for gResearch bounced.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:52)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Hey all, we're getting back into some bad ticket staleness. @tim @tannenba @tlmiller please update your tickets from the dashboard: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=11620">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=11620</a><br/>

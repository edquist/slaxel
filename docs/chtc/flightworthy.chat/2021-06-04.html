<h3>Fri Jun 4, 2021 : #flightworthy (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:43)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @coatsworth @ckoch5 @lmichael Any DAGMan experts that can provide me advice on how to answer questions at <a href="https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2021-June/msg00000.shtml">https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2021-June/msg00000.shtml</a> ?  Looks like the .dag file does not support all the useful macros that a submit file does, like $ENV() etc, so what do folks do instead???<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:26)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> @tannenba I've been trying to figure out a workaround but yeah, this is correct, PRE and POST scripts only allow a handful of macros.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:07)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> does DAG have its own internal variable syntax? Like, can you do:<br/><pre>HOME=/home/blah<br/><br/>SCRIPT PRE $HOME/script.sh</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:37)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I guess that doesnâ€™t really address the issue of automating what home is. :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:37)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Nope, DAGMan has no such feature<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:56)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (And a way to define selection from a list of (nested) ClassAds would make it very easy to make the list of which aggregates to generate customizable...)<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(20:40:26)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Not familiar with some of these in CMS, but:<br/>A) we would occasionally wrap things in JSON arrays as it can safely serialize arbitrary strings (unlike splitting by commas in ClassAds) and is more reliable in places that might hit the old parser or more memory efficient than ClassAd lists,<br/>B) sometimes we would use the job ClassAd as a way to provide input data for jobs (instead of a separate input file) or monitoring information.  So, as far as condor is concerned, itâ€™s an opaque byte string.<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:15)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I need to step through with debugger to be sure<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:25)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> BTW.  I checked on <a href="http://cm.chtc.wisc.edu">cm.chtc.wisc.edu</a> (where I yoinked this accountant log from) and it has similar messages on the 23rd which appears to be the last time the negotiator was started<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:19)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Further investigation,  it seems that what I took to be an uninitialized variable being printed above is actual records in the accountant log.<br/>out of about 7000 distinct submitters, at least 4 have non-printing or symbol characters.  one is the empty string, and at least two are inappropriately quoted.  but the code is handling these "correctly" in the sense that it is not in danger of crashing.<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:22)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> @coatsworth Is there a way to control the environment of the SCHEDULER universe job when you run condor_submit_dag?  if you could do that then $ENV() in the submit file would work.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:20)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> @johnkn They don't want to use it in the submit file, they want to use it in the .dag file.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:57)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I thought they wanted to use it in submit files in the DAG?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:41)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> No, I see the title mislead me.  they want to use it in PRE and POST script declarations.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:39)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @gthain At HTCondor Week you talked about the new floor/ceiling options for user accounting in the negotiator.  Cool beans.  But didn't you also implement fair-share across groups this past year as well?  Please remind me what the story is re fair share across groups, thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:08)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> We implemented measuring and advertising the fair share across groups, but didn't implement any scheduling based on it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:12)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> If we are going to be supporting 8.8 releases for longer, then we need to keep that in mind when we make platform decisions in the batlab.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:57)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> What platforms does OSG support?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:12)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Guess we need to find out<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:50)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Or will OSG still be doing their own builds?   Does the updates repo only need to have source rpms?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:40)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Right now, OSG fully supports EL7 and has partial support for EL8. (Also, they have 1 HTCondor-CE running Ubuntu20, kind of a way to say that HTCondor-CE works on any Linux)<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:31)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> It sounds like we would be the only ones building HTCondor.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> OSG will continue to have its own HTCondor builds, coordinating any patches with FW/HTCSS dev team/PAThFinders<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:48)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> :fanfare:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:10)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (at least in the short/medium term)<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:42)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt;  Also, they have 1 HTCondor-CE running Ubuntu20<br/>Who is this "they"?  Remember, we are all paid from the same project!<br/>

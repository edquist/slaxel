<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:38)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> So Lauren asked me to look into what's going on with <tt>ExitCode</tt> not being set in jobs when <tt>OnExitHold</tt> fires.  The problem, of course, is our obsession with only updating those parts of the job ad which we've hard-coded as being worthy of the schedd's attention.  Specifically: the shadow updates its copy of the job ad with an <tt>ExitCode</tt> when the starter conveys that information, and then "updates" the job ad.  Because we are so very, very clever, <tt>ATTR_ON_EXIT_CODE</tt> is only _not_ ignored when the update "type" is <tt>U_TERMINATE</tt>.  Of course, the shadow never sends an update of this type, because <tt>terminateJob()</tt> is never called -- the <tt>OnExitHold</tt> expression is evaluated first and <tt>holdJob()</tt> is called instead.  Adding <tt>ATTR_ON_EXIT_CODE</tt> to the allow-list for holds confirms this analysis.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:59)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> This solution seems unsatisfactory.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:27)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> <tt>ATTR_ON_EXIT_CODE</tt> is set by the shadow in <tt>resourceExit()</tt>, which is called from <tt>pseduo_job_exit()</tt>, which "updates" the job ad with type <tt>U_STATUS</tt>.  We _could_ add a bunch of attributes to <tt>U_STATUS</tt> (which is currently empty)... or we could actually do a _complete_ update, since the starter is now gone.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:47)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Does anyone know why we don't?  (I've been told that we always do a complete update before the shadow exits, but that's obviously not true.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:22)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Is the bug really that we don't always do a complete update before exiting?)<br/>

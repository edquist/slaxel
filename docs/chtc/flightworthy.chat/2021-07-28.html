<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:08)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Hey all, my understanding from @tim is that our security release was v9.1.1, so our next full devel release is going to be v9.1.2. Is that correct? I can't seem to find a V9_1_2-branch anywhere.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:16)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I believe that’s correct. I suspect Tim hasn’t had a chance to do all of the version fixups, due to family emergency.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:14)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Thanks, that's sort of what I expected. Fingers crossed everything is going okay for Tim :crossed_fingers:<br/>

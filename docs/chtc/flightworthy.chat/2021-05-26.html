<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:07)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... I'm about half-way through my last-minute review of my slides.  I'll try to join in.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:16)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Sorry I'm underwater with emails and last-minute prep<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:41)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> @tlmiller if youâ€™re doing self checkpointing by signal, will <tt>condor_drain</tt> (or other commands) tell the starter(s) to send that signal to jobs that it knows can checkpoint?<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:40)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> David Gardner is asking about ways of getting self-checkpointing to work nicely with e.g. a cloud resource running out time<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:28)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> ToddM is answering a question admin room right now.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:25)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> we have some actual interest in the restd! David Lamarche said he wanted to get out of the business of parsing command-line output<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:20)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> @jcpatton Good question.  You may also need to set <tt>KillSig</tt> to <tt>CheckpointSig</tt>.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:35)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @bbockelman et all - we can reproduce the problem Kenyi observed and working on it now.  Perhaps another patch for the V9_1_4-branch. The new X509 delegation code fails when the client is new and the server (receiving the delegation) is old.  Interestingly, it does work the other way around.  So old-&gt;new works, new-&gt;new works, new-&gt;old fails.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:45)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> We had purposefully tested all three combinations previously when this code was originally merged, so not sure what happened here.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:16)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @coatsworth In Greg's absence, how is the LIGO call going?  Do you need me to drop into the Zoom or is it business as usual ?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:20)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> @tannenba LIGO call is going well, no need to join.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:45)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> @tannenba / @jfrey - thanks for looking into this!  I'd be happy with a 9_1_4 branch if that's doable.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:00)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> @tannenba - to make sure I understand your statement, if we update the execute hosts on the OSPool to 9.1.3, we will not hit this issue?<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:14)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @bbockelman Yes, that is what our testing this morning shows.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:35)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> v9.1.3 -&gt; v9.1.3 appears to work.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:05)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> And v9.0.4 schedd -&gt; v9.1.3 starter works?<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:15)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Yes. v9.1.3 sender -&gt; v9.0.4 receiver triggers the failure.<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:48)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Hey all, is anybody able to take HTCONDOR-437 for a code review? This is the DAGMan SERVICE node requested by LIGO (and several others). I need to get this done by Friday so I can get it into the v9.1.3 release. <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-437">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/HTCONDOR-437</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:48)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I may be able to get to that this afternoon.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:57)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I will assign it to myself if I do.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:58)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I can take it, but I may not have time to look at it for a few days.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:00)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> @tlmiller Thank you, would be great if you could!<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:30)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> @tannenba @bbockelman I have a fix for the proxy delegation failure: HTCONDOR-674<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:32)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> wonderful!<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:46)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @tannenba @gthain and anybody else who queries the <a href="http://glidein-cm.chtc.wisc.edu">glidein-cm.chtc.wisc.edu</a> collector, you should now be able to do so without fancy HTCondor knob magic, at least from CHTC submit nodes;  I tweaked configuration to allow querying with <tt>ANONYMOUS</tt> authentication method<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:18)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Hopefully nothing was broken in the process &gt;_&gt;<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:34)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> thanks!<br/>

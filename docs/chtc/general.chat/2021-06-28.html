<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @jstathas for the External Communications doc, does "technical support provided to external groups" include Freshdesk tickets, htcondor-admin/htcondor-support tickets, and/or random troubleshooting over email or Slack?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:35)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (I don't have access to the doc so I can't see how detailed it is)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:19)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Can I assume @jstathas will copy over the relevant section from the Flightworthy report w.r.t. to that?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:44)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (I mean, htcondor-admin/htcondor-support should just always be in the list already...)<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:53)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> 1. @matyas Yes, but actually @tannenba has been acquiring that content and including it in External Communications. Here is an example of the Content:  Monitoring and responding to questions on htcondor-users, htcondor-devel, and htcondor-admin email lists. <br/>2. Regular bBiweekly meetings and/or hi-touch technical support with the following groups: Fermilab, CMS, kBase, LIGO, George Washington University, CNAF, NRAO, IHEP, Covid HPC Allocations, LSST/DES, COPASI. <br/>3. Note: Started regular meetings with COPASI (<a href="http://copasi.org">http://copasi.org</a>), a team that maintains a biochemical portal for simulation and analysis that uses HTCondor on the backend for dHTC.  We are wWorking with COPASI as an engaged community interested in utilizing campus HPC resources via HTCSS “boscoBosco” technology. <br/>4. Continued Ongoing help to LIGO getting get them set up with a test SciTokens workflow (using a local-issuer CredMon). <br/>5. Regular biweekly meetings with SIPI (Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, a Tribal College) and AIHEC CI Team re a collaboration supporting SIPI’s ArcGIS curriculum by provisioning remotely accessible Windows resources that ultimately can backfill with Open Science Pool Linux jobs. Hardware order has been delayed; in the meantime, installed Windows Server on a testing virtual machine, and started configuration and licensing of Remote Desktop Services. <br/><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:17)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... I think that answered my question, too. :)<br/>

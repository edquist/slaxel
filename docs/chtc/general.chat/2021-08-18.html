<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:23)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> Note the email today from the Chancellor office : you must submit to weekly Covid tests unless you are vaccinated *and* have uploaded your vaccination record to University Health Services.  So if you haven't yet been vaccinated (!!!), or more likely you haven't uploaded your vaccination record, upload it asap!<br/>

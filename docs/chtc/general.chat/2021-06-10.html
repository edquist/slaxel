<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:11:06)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... has anyone else been having electrical problems this morning?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:16:12)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Not here<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:16:31)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I'm on the far side of the lake from you though.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:22)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> No electrical problems here, but I'm sure with a lot of AC running, the other grid is under strain<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:42)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Yeah, we turned on our AC for the first time today.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:07)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I need to get my AC replaced. My condensator... um... spontaneously combusted.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:41)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> hmm.  fire does generally cause condensation...<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:27)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> it was raining so it was kinda hard to tell the difference<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:24)</span> <b>jwatkins498:</b></span> Hi everyone! If I haven't met you yet, I'm helping out with some of the communications efforts for PATh. I'd like to do a story on the invasive species horizon scanning that the USGS is conducting (this was the subject of Richard Erickson's talk on the second day of HTCondor Week). If anyone has an existing relationship with Richard (or another team member) and can connect us for an interview please DM me. Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:41)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> ^^^ @tannenba do you know the USGS guys well?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:46)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I'm on it<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:05)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> Re USGS, I know a few of them, and I would say I know Michael F very well.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:02)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @gthain @jwatkins498 If Greg is on it, great, else feel free to ping me and I can do introductions....<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:03)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148698">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148698</a> fwiw - here's the "OSG Next Five Year" grant which lasted for approximately 9 years...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:44)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I missed the first part of what Miron said, before he mentioned that he didn't expect everyone to be around for (all of) the meetings during the summer?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:00)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I think if we had tried to call it "OSG Next Nine Years" we might have had more trouble getting it<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:26)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt; he didn't expect everyone to be around for (all of) the meetings during the summer?<br/>As in, there will be some meetings which will be a waste of time for everyone to attend.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:00)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Ah, that makes a little more sense.  What was he saying before that?<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:20)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Something about talking about organization / structure of CHTC I think?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:26)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Sounds like you didn't think it was very important?<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:48)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0437810&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0437810&amp;HistoricalAwards=false</a><br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:13)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt;  Sounds like you didn't think it was very important?<br/>Nah, just forgot the exact wording.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:01)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0850745&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0850745&amp;HistoricalAwards=false</a> here's the second award<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:06)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1321762&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1321762&amp;HistoricalAwards=false</a> and the ABR<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:19)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I'd would appreciate it if you could summarize, then.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:08)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> @tlmiller my understanding was that Miron wants to talk more about PATh - kind of what the project is all about.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:35)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> And this history lesson is context/setup for some of those discussions<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:46)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> If the part I missed isn't relevant, that's fine, just say so. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:26)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> (I think it was the lead in to the story, no important details)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:21)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK, thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:29)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Huh - I guess Chapter 2 is next week!<br/>

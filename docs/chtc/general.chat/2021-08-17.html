<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:19)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Dane County has been in the “High” category of level of community transmission for … a few weeks now? But just barely — we’re right around an average of 15–20 new positive cases per day per 100,000 people. To put that in perspective, it was not hard to find counties in Florida and Alabama with 10 times that rate. Both count as “High”, which is the highest CDC level right now, but obviously there is a big difference.<br/>

<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @jstathas by “External Communications”, you mean “Community Empowerment”?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:50)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (i.e. all workshops/events, community-building (HTCondor-Users, and external comms?)<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:43)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> @lmichael - Yes that is correct.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @tannenba minor nit: In the PATh proposal, I’m fairly certain that consultation with specific groups/orgs was just under HTCSS, not Community Empowerment (‘personalized’ versus ‘community-oriented’ work). But I suppose we can keep things as-is.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:58:18)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> Hi Lauren, I agree with you, which is why in the first few reports it was in HTCSS. However, Miron wanted it moved, so we moved it. <br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:32)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah. I didn’t realize that. Like I said, we can keep things as-is.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:13)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Hi all, I know there's a calendar somewhere listing all the big HEP conferences and other related events, can someone link me to it?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:38)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Sure, hold on a sec. It’s the HSF calendar.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:56:04)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> This page talks about editing, but I think the URL is fine for viewing, too? <a href="https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/calendar.html">https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/calendar.html</a><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:56:59)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Perfect, thank you!<br/>

<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:27:28)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I was pleasantly surprised when I moved from my home network to my parents' home network and the connections through the GlobalProtect CS VPN continued on like nothing happened. I suspended my laptop, drove for 20 minutes, resumed my laptop and it all worked.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Chancellors (just now) email says no masks needed for vaccinated folks indoors, starting June 2 (with some exceptions).<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:11)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> [When was the last time one of those emails got the links right on the first try?]<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:30)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> There must be a market for a plugin to check links before an email is sent<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Of note:<br/><pre>If you were vaccinated by UW Health or another off-campus provider, and haven't yet uploaded your record, please upload your documentation of vaccination to UHS. The more we understand our community's vaccination participation, the better decisions we can make about campus operations and health policies.</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <pre>Q – Can my unit/research lab/event require that everyone wear masks regardless of vaccination status?<br/><br/>No, unless it is a clinical or health care setting. However, wearing a mask in these settings can be encouraged. In addition, anyone, regardless of vaccination status, can continue to wear a mask indoors or outdoors.</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <pre>Q – Is there still a requirement to maintain physical distancing?<br/><br/>The indoor physical distancing requirements remains at least 6 feet, regardless of vaccination status. Outdoors, individuals who are not vaccinated should maintain 6 feet physical distancing and if physical distancing is not possible, wear a face covering.</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:55)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Also worth noting that they're carrying on with not enforcing the 'if vaccinated' bit.<br/>

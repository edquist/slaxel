<h3>Thu Aug 5, 2021 : #general (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:31)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Over the next, oh, 24 hours or so, I need to update my OSG School slides on self-checkpointing. I have questions. Who can answer detailed questions about the behavior of exit-based self-checkpointing?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:16)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I wrote the code, but it's entirely possibly that ChristinaK knows more about how it actually behaves in practice at this point.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:51)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I had that knowledge 2 weeks ago…can’t speak for today. :joy:<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:34)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I’ll write out my questions in email and send it to both of you.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:03)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Hi all - just got off the phone with Miron.  He confirms we are on for the team meeting at 2.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:49)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Gonna be a small group, methinks<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:07)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Some of use will have to leave for OSGVS at 2:30<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:28)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Yup, obviously leave when appropriate.<br/>

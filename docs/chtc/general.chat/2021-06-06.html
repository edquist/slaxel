<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(22:31:36)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> My favorite war story in CMS was the attempt to track down a single core in the entire WLCG that had a bad AVX unit.  At the time, the only thing that would trigger the unit was zlib compression (meaning the results appeared good but the compressed data was garbage).  Eventually our butts were saved by the fact that CMS was using UUID1 to generate file names - meaning the MAC address of the worker node was embedded in the file names.  Once we realized that, we could locate the affected files and identify the single problem core on the single worker node in France.  Scary the only reason we found it was a mistake in the UUID algorithm we chose...<br/>

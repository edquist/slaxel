<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:02)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Huh, that is terrifying.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:29)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What’s a researcher to do?<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:43)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> write good AI for WoW goldfarming, of course<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:43)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Run everything two or three times and look for mismatches in results?<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:26)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> (use CHTC to train the NN, of course)<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:50)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> All the more reason to generate seeds for monte-carlo runs a-priori, and not during the run<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:52)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> But still, that only helps if you run multiple times, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:34)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Right, but you need to be sure to not get in the monte-carlo trap of saying "well, it's all just random inputs, so I can't try to reproduce my results"<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:45)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I was thinking of some sort of pre-run check, but that doesn’t seem like it would help — not only would you have to find a way to force the use of certain instructions (which ones?) but there’s no guarantee your actual payload would run on the same core.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:07)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What a mess.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:49)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> The facebook paper said their problem was triggered by problems uncompressing.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:49)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> What was news to me was that these problems were deterministic.  We've all heard of comic ray hit randomly flipping bits, or row-hammer like attacks intermittently changing results, but seems like in this case some particular core always gives the wrong answer.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:43)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt;  but seems like in this case some particular core always gives the wrong answer.<br/>That's at least what we saw in CMS - problematic core wasn't problematic enough to crash the program but we could detect bitflips decompressing the data because of the built-in checksum for zlib data.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:33)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Didn’t LIGO used to run all their stuff twice (?) to look for discrepancies?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:08)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Only on GPUs when they were using commodity GPUs<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(20:53:20)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> @bbockelman What did you do with the errant machine?  I bet our architecture group here might be interested in it<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:55)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face: It's a debugging scavenger hunt!<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:30:37)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> @clock - it doesn't look like there's a PR for that yet?<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:52)</span> <b>clock:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:13)</span> <b>clock:</b></span> I am getting a Validation Error and figured I would give it a minute<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:29)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Huh.  Never saw that message before!<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:05)</span> <b>clock:</b></span> This is related to the news update ^ I am figuring out slack yet<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:19)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> What's your thinking for the *<tt>//TODO DECIDED ON WHAT TO PUT UP HERE</tt>?*<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Looking good! We’ve got to get some better home page content, though. Would love to hear what Cannon gets from Miron in terms of input, and then I’m happy to help write it!<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:06)</span> <b>clock:</b></span> @bbockelman I wanted to put something there to demo, but wanted it obvious I knew it was broken<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:55)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Let's work on whittling down the critical-path items.  Should get V1 out the door then iterate.  For example, can we simply cut out that navigation piece and turn it into a ticket?<br/><br/>The other critical path item I noticed is the homepage logos are super-pixelated now that they're larger.  Cannon, I think you have a copy of a larger OSG logo (and probably a HTCondor one?); how about NEOS?  @lmichael - would you have any lead on a better NEOS logo?<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:52)</span> <b>clock:</b></span> Sounds good, I was unsure how quickly we wanted this iteration out. Will add this to my list.<br/>

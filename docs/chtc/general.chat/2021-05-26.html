<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(17:48:40)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I have ... thoughts<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(17:46:17)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Will we have the opportunity to provide input on the new CDIS building design?<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:58)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> thanks for the KB link Mat, I hadn't seen that CS was scheduling classes only in first-floor rooms.  And they just re-did the room between towers 2 and 3 on our floor, too :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> lol<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:56)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> covid is so 2019<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah ok<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:00)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> they're gone<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what do the "Wellness Amabassadors" do at the entrances check for then?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:53)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> you don't need that anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> &gt;  A free, easy-to-use mobile app called <a href="https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/spring-semester-2021-overview/#safer-badgers">Safer Badgers</a> will help employees and others schedule tests, quickly obtain test results, and access additional health resources.<br/>great time for my phone to die<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> in theory, register here: <a href="https://apps.cs.wisc.edu/building-access/">https://apps.cs.wisc.edu/building-access/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:05)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> <a href="https://kb.wisc.edu/cs/page.php?id=94453">https://kb.wisc.edu/cs/page.php?id=94453</a><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey, what's the process for office access these days? I think I may have to go in tomorrow because the construction across the street is literally making my apartment vibrate<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:24)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (The grammatical term may be "mass noun.")<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:11)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (I think the word I was looking for is 'fungible'.)<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:07)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> maybe describing it as a mass noun?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:16)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (e.g., you don't have "a sand", you have "a gallon of sand")<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:05)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> What's the word that means "this type of word requires a unit of measurement"?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:13)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> I certainly wasn't going to put Pegasus in the main room and the GPU panel in a breakout :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:39)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Yeah, the GPU panel is just in the main room.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:35)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I hope so. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:11)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> &gt; I got an email with room numbers for the office hours, but not on for the GPU panel.  does that mean the GPU panel is in the main room?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:34)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> maybe someone should attend this, later today: <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/news/join-us-for-the-upcoming-it-projects-forum/">https://it.wisc.edu/news/join-us-for-the-upcoming-it-projects-forum/</a> ?<br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:12)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> I'm listening in the background.  It's being recorded and should probably show up as a link on that page later.<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:53:56)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> there’s some variation - looks like individual emails are fine, but things I’m getting via a mailing list or as an email from a server are not getting forwarded.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(08:44:11)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> It looks like our CSL-managed aliases (<a href="mailto:htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu">htcondor-admin@cs.wisc.edu</a>, <a href="mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu">chtc@cs.wisc.edu</a>) are still ok though<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(08:42:20)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> Heads up, it looks like DoIT (or Microsoft?) might have changed some campus email settings around 3 AM, one of them being that automatic email forwarding no longer works.<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:24)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I haven't been able to add a watcher to JIRA tickets (HTCONDOR, if it matters) the last two times I tried.  I used to be able to do this.  Who do I talk to get this fixed?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think that's my fault because i dropped admin privs for most folks -- i forget if we can add that ability to non-admins or we just have to give admin back to everyone<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:58)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK.  It's probably better if not everyone's an admin, so I don't know if it'd be worth it to change back just for this.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Pretty sure I was able to add watchers when Indiana was hosting JIRA and I sure wasn't an admin on that instance<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> try it now @tlmiller<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:29)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Works now.  Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what i did (@coatsworth, @jstathas):<br/>1. Create an HTCONDOR-specific Jira permission scheme<br/>2. Added the HTCONDOR 'developers' group to the list of folks that can "manage watchers"<br/>3. reassociated the HTCONDOR project with their permission scheme<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:02)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> Thanks for the info!<br/>

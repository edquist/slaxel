<h3>Sat Jun 12, 2021 : #batlab (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:01)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Well now we put all our eggs in one basket and the results are not pretty. 40 some test jobs on one machine and the load average is approaching 600. It is spending 70+% in system, only about 8% in user, iowait is less than 2%. So, our jobs are pretty badly behaved and now we have many spurious test failures. Perhaps, we should run fewer tests simultaneously in a job. Or allocate more resources to test runs. Either way, we'd have fewer simultaneous test runs.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:15)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Maybe our test jobs are not badly behaved. There just seems to be a tipping point where things melt down.<br/>

<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(07:33:44)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I just noticed the that querying by user name is also available: <a href="https://batlab.chtc.wisc.edu/results/workspace.php?days=30&amp;user=tim">https://batlab.chtc.wisc.edu/results/workspace.php?days=30&amp;user=tim</a><br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:06)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @tlmiller @gthain My final build for 9.1.3 is not starting up on e2460. Looking at it now. What there are recent change?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:42)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> On that host, I presume?  Nothing, as far as I know.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:58)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> The startd left at 13:51<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:37)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> It says shutdown fast??<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:42)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @wiscmoate any reason the startd it stopped on e2460 (out batlab node)<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:41)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I will try to restart it, in a few minutes if there is no objection.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:03)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Oh, wait, you mean the _build_ isn't starting.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:07)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK, now I'm much less panicked.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:35)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Yup, the build did not start. I will kick e2460 now.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:44)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Although the following looks kind of dire:<br/><pre>08/19/21 13:44:09 (D_ALWAYS) SECMAN: FAILED: Received "DENIED" from server for user e2460@ssl_letsencrypt_chtc using method SSL.<br/>08/19/21 13:44:09 (D_ALWAYS) ERROR: SECMAN:2010:Received "DENIED" from server for user e2460@ssl_letsencrypt_chtc using method SSL.<br/>08/19/21 13:44:09 (D_ALWAYS) Failed to start non-blocking update to &lt;128.104.100.52:9618&gt;.</pre><br/><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:47)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (from the master log)<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:35)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> And the MasterLog filled with something about getting a token request approved, is less than helpful.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:03)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Indeed.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:47)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> We should probably file a ticket about that.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:49)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> My builds are running. So, that's what's most important for me.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:19)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK, good.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:34)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I've gotten a few emails from that machine recently, but I didn't see any from today.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:17)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Nothing in condor-obits. So, kind of odd.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:42)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... ah, I think I get those emails only from Metronome.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:16)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @tim e2455 through e2485 have been under quite a bit of change over the last month -<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:37)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> It's not unfathomable that e2460 was impacted negatively<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:55)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> So as of a few minutes ago, going from 10 builds back on the personal-runs page to 11 builds back goes from asking about 115 runs to asking about 172 runs, and when we ask about details, from ~40k rows to about ~240k rows.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:20)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I presume the 11th run is one of the GregT specials.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:10)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> This causes the big complicated query about the details to go from ~6 seconds to approximately 32 seconds (on the database server; remote queries or maybe just PHP make everything take longer).<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:33)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> So limiting how many builds back we go won't really solve the problem.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:54)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I will spend a few minutes trying to optimize the query, but I don't have any good ideas.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:40)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> So, seems like submitting multiple tests from a single build is worse for the dashboard than submitting independent build &amp; tests<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:30)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> It's harder to limit how long the dashboard takes to display, anyway.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:11)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (The dashboard also doesn't do a good job of displaying the results of multiple test runs for one build except on the run-details page, but that's probably a different problem.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:47)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> The obvious attempt at optimization thankfully didn't do anything.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:36:31)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> How many tests did you submit, btw?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:32)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> 1 build, 16 tests, IIRC<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:00)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Which doesn't really seem any more than we do in a typical day<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:14)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> The slowdown does seem excessive.  115-&gt;172 seems a little low, but a 5x slowdown seems too high.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:29)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (I mean, even the 10-build query is rather slow for some reason.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:40)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... I guess I can try kicking the MySQL daemon.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:16)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> That improved the fast page quite a bit, but the slow page still isn't responding at all, basically.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:16)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK, I'm going to give up on that for now.<br/>

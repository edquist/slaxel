<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:52)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Not that we have parallel builds, we should divide up the CentOS7 build machine into multi-core slots. It has 12 cores. We seldom have 12 jobs in flight. How about 3 4-core slots?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:55)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Maybe same with the mac?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:13)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I wonder if we should move the Windows machines into VMs on the 128 core batlab machine<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:00)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> The macs are already divided into 4 slots. I think they have 32 cores. So, we should parallelize there as well. I don't know if we lie about the number of CPUs or not.<br/>I think that moving the Windows machines to VMs makes sense.<br/>

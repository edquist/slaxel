<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:08)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @tlmiller Greg did a boatload of personal tests on the BaTLab last week and made the "Personal Runs" dashboard unusable. Would it be easy to limit that dashboard to number of runs like the "Per Commit" dashboard is?<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:18)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Huh.  I was able to see the results Friday night<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:01)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Sometimes it worked and sometime, it hung forever.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:32)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... it's still hung for me.  Hrm.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:31)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I will investigate later today; I suspect it won't be hard to limit the number of runs the personal-runs page displays.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:11)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Is there some difference in the query the personal runs page does vs the per-commit builds that would cause problems for the former vs the latter for the same number of results?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:11:18)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ... the number of results is limited on the latter but not the former?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:00)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (There may well be.  The pages aren't very well designed.)<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:27)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> right now I get around the issue with: <a href="https://batlab.chtc.wisc.edu/results/workspace.php?days=1">https://batlab.chtc.wisc.edu/results/workspace.php?days=1</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:59)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Nice.<br/>

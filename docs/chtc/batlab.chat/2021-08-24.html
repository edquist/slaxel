<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:34)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @wiscmoate <a href="http://batlab-mac-0.chtc.wisc.edu">batlab-mac-0.chtc.wisc.edu</a> is offline. Doesn't even ping. Not urgent, because batlab-mac-1 is still fine. However, next time it is convenient, please to get it going again.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:38)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Weird<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:00)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @tim it was powered down for whatever reason;  back up.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:44)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Cool, thank you.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:26)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> So, it pings, but it hasn't joined the pool. Maybe @jfrey or @tlmiller could take a look. I don't have a login there.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:50)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I’ll take a look<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:46)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> The machine is up now. The procd aborted because its parent’s birthdate was after its own.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:03)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> a glitch in the matrix?<br/>

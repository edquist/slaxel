<h3>Wed Jun 9, 2021 : #batlab (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:41)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> At the OPS meeting today, I requested a dedicated CHTC node for use by FW so we can have more control of the environment for test jobs.  BrianB suggested we be given one of the new fast nodes with an SSD.  The name of the node will be posted in this channel and FW will take over configuration  (via our override file) of that node for the duration of our testing push.<br/>

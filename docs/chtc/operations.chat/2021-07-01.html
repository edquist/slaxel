<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:07:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Probably someone adding something like the following to their job?:<br/><pre>+AccountingGroup = "spalding"</pre><br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:56)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Isn't that actually the correct syntax?  (Where <tt>spalding</tt> would otherwise be an attribute reference.)  Would getting the quotes have to be from something more like<br/><pre>AccountingGroup = "spalding"</pre><br/>?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Thanks! That variability/detail still isn’t straight in my head, which is why I said “something like”. If people add AccountingGroup or +AccountingGroup, it replaces their user identity in our report structure.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:53)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I wasn't sure which of us was making the syntax mistake, actually, and I didn't know if the "something like" was for synax or the name of the attribute.  Anyway, if it's really an irritant, I'm pretty sure there's a job transform that will strip quotes. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:45)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I happen to just know from screen sharing that this is Nathan doing this<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:37)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> he’s submitting from <tt><a href="http://spaldingsubmitnew.botany.wisc.edu">spaldingsubmitnew.botany.wisc.edu</a></tt> as (local) user <tt>nate</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:52)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I mean, if two of us aren't sure, I can't blame a user for confusing the two.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:03)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> Nathan is changing his group back to <tt>spalding</tt> without the quotes for now so he shows back up under the right project<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:07)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> booooo<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:18)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I have been reported for trying <tt>sudo</tt> on hpclogin1 :slightly_smiling_face: we have a user that would like their <tt>.bashrc</tt> reset because they messed up their environment, though I also gave them some manual instructions<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:38)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> We should totally customize the error message to include the link to that XKCD cartoon. :joy:<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:07)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> @jcpatton - that's not _totally_ indicative of an error (but often is).  On some really high-memory jobs, we've observed the kernel taking obscene amounts of time migrating processes between NUMA nodes (particularly years back when hugepages were new).<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:33)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @lmichael @blin @ckoch5 @tannenba please stick around on zoom for about 10 minutes after and we'll do a recap<br/>

<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(12:01:27)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> We'll do it later<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:31)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Thank you for attending!<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Sorry I missed the recap note. monthly report to finalize before other interviews/meetings today.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:30)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> Sure!<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:21)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> Nathan is submitting jobs from <tt><a href="http://spaldingsubmitnew.botany.wisc.edu">spaldingsubmitnew.botany.wisc.edu</a></tt> and can’t seem to use <tt>condor_ssh_to_job</tt>, it appears to be some kind of security issue. I was able to fix an issue he was having with running <tt>condor_q -better</tt> by adding the same <tt>TOOL.SEC_</tt> settings from CHTC.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:35)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> What version of HTCondor is installed on <tt>spaldingsubmitnew</tt>?<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:51)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I don’t know exactly, but it should be 9.0+<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:34)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Hrm.  I don't know; my guess was going to be something along the lines of AES vs not, otherwise.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:59)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I wouldn’t discount it being something like that<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:21)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I _thought_ all 9.0.x could talk to all 9.1.x, but I don't know the AES details.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:44)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> At least one of the versions involved is also an RC, which always makes me nervous.<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:04)</span> <b>zmiller:</b></span> <pre>ReconcileSecurityPolicyAds() failed</pre><br/>One side is requiring something that the other side cannot provide, in terms of AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTION, or INTEGRITY.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:22)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Ahh, so not in terms of algorithms?<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:36)</span> <b>zmiller:</b></span> I don't think that would cause a failure that early on.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:49)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> OK, well that sounds a lot easier to fix. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:32)</span> <b>zmiller:</b></span> (I could be wrong.  It probably /should/ fail if there are no algorithms and the feature is required)<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:04)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I know the schedd authenticates with the CHTC collector using idtokens, and I think that’s the only non-FS auth allowed<br/>

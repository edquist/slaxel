<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:32)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> @tjslauson update on HPC maintenance here once you’re wrapped up + we’ll send an email out tomorrow<br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:07)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> @ckoch5 Emile and I are playing Whac-A-Mole with some last exec nodes, then I restore a fresh copy of the old job states (I've been mucking with the current copy of the data for the past 3 hours) and we start bringing the system up after that.  My hope is it'll be up by 6pm.<br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(18:48:16)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> @lmichael @ckoch5 update: we're done with maintenance, but I'm opting to unrestrict tomorrow morning due to what hour it is now.  hpclogin2 is having issues keeping its mount points (I haven't seen anything yet to think that the host itself is the problem, but need to troubleshoot before calling it stable).  hpclogin1 seems to be fine - I'll be checking on it in the morning.<br/>

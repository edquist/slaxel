<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:48)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> <a href="http://exec-11.batlab.org">exec-11.batlab.org</a> is missing from the batlab pool. (the Win8 box).  and I cannot RDP to it.<br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(09:46:43)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> yup, monitoring lost contact with it early this morning.  I'm taking a look at it.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:46)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:15)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> should be back.  The hardware asserted an error of some kind, but wasn't able to log to the hardware log what happened.  I've cleared the log to make room for next time.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:25)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> btw, one of the disks on the front was flashing amber.  Do you have the tools on that box to check SMART status?  I could also see how much info the management interface will give on disk status (some of our servers can give me that info through the management interface, I'm not sure about this one).<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:26)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> I'm not aware of any specific smart tools, I could look at disk manager and see if it considers the drive "healthy", but I don't know how to get details.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:39)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> that'd be enough - I wasn't planning on looking too far into whichever SMART metrics the manufacturer records, just the overall health assessment<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:41)</span> <b>johnkn:</b></span> Disk management shows two spindles,  ~270 Gb each.  the second one is nearly empty and used only for condor EXECUTE<br/>both are reported as "healthy", FWIW<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:24)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> kk<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:40)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> there were 4 drives in the front - wonder if the amber one just isn't being used.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:10)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> thanks for checking from that end<br/>

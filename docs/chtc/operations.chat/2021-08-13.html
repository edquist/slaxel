<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:46)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @eturatsinze let me know the status of the HPC chassis/nodes, when you get a chance? Iâ€™ll send updates to the faculty, today.<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:22)</span> <b>eturatsinze:</b></span> I swapped in the new network cards in both hpc441 (Morgan) and hpc457 (Schmidt) and the network issue is resolved. They are up but not in the pool yet. They'll get added after next week's maintenance.<br/>hpc413 (cumulus) is still down - working with Dell on that.<br/>

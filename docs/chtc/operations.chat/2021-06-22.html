Anderson partition nodes down? <a href="https://crt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=103552">https://crt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=103552</a><br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:01)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> @jcpatton last week I took care of a handful of nodes that Slurm momentarily lost contact with and marked down.  Looks like one out of eight of the Anderson nodes got marked down again after I took care of them.  I've given it a once-over and marked it up again.<br/>

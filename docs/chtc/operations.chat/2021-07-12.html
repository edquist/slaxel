<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:23)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @lmichael @ckoch5 @jcpatton we let a docker cache SSL cert expire in CS 2360;  this will probably cause docker jobs in CS 2360 to fail.  I've asked for a renewal, and I'm about to prohibit docker jobs from running in that datacenter temporarily<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:40)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Does this include batlab jobs?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(10:13:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @tjslauson @eturatsinze @kcramer Just looking for an update on the morgan (nodes 441-444), schmidt MRSEC (457-460), and szlurfarska nodes (461-468). Let me know what you know since we last chatted on Wed in Ops. (Their owners are asking.)<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X8Ppetzj0c3PRD6_XPFNK2KfYC-5eaWc0XdSsVYxUFI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X8Ppetzj0c3PRD6_XPFNK2KfYC-5eaWc0XdSsVYxUFI/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:51)</span> <b>eturatsinze:</b></span> <tt>461-468</tt> newest arrival, we just racked them. They still need provisioning and addition to slurm.<br/><tt>441-444</tt> Chassis is being problematic, troubleshooting effort by Me and Tim haven't resulted in a fix yet. We're about to involve Dell.<br/><tt>457-460</tt> 1 of the 4 sleds is having issues. We're keeping the whole chassis out so we can troubleshoot. We'll probably get Dell involved.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> When are you planning to provision <tt>461-468</tt> and get in touch with Dell for <tt>441-444</tt> and <tt>457-460</tt> ? Just curious because that’s all I had heard by last Wednesday, and the two with known issues were received months ago, which is why the PIs are wondering. I’d like to be able to tell them more about what our plans and timelines are.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-13 16:27:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ping ^<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-13 16:38:32)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> we're reaching out to Dell this afternoon for support on all of those nodes.  There is no timeline - we don't know enough yet to make those kinds of estimates.  We should hopefully know more about these issues within a week.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-13 16:39:31)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> I saw your earlier message - it was in my to-do list.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-13 16:41:18)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> regarding 461-468, it was in my to-do list to work more on provisioning those nodes today.  I haven't been able to do that - been getting pinged a lot this afternoon.<br/>

<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:02)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @gthain<br/>&gt;  Does this include batlab jobs?<br/>I presume so, since they're running in docker universe<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:20:14)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @lmichael @ckoch5 @jcpatton @gthain I got a certificate renewal quicker than expected; pulled a docker image from the docker cache and all seemed well;  re-enabling docker jobs in CS 2360<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:53)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> For Morgridge folks:<br/>&gt;  As conditions change, our policies do too. This would be a good time to update you on a Morgridge-specific policy in the works. We intend to put in place a vaccination mandate for current and future Morgridge employees and affiliates. We are working on the details and will provide them as soon as they are ready.<br/>Mind you, vaccines are close to required for folks coming into the building (the rule is "if you're unvaccinated and can work from home, then you must work from home") but this will make it a harder requirement.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:06)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> So hopefully everyone can breath a bit easier in the building!<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Well they're not fooling around. Do you know if masks will still be mandatory after everybody's vaccinated? (Once the Dane county order expires of course.)<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:28)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> I think that's a separate decision.  Dane County makes it easy now, of course.<br/>

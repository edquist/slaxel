<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:50)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Do Guam (USA) and New Caledonia (France) count as separate countries for reporting? If they do, we have people from 33 different countries this year (up from 25 last year)!<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> 1. It's neat that we got people from there<br/>2. I'd say US territories count as part of the US... at least that's what I did for Puerto Rico when I got some numbers for OSG.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:48)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Agree and I think you're right, I just wish we could count people from the Pacific Islands separately :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Maybe we should have a field for 'people we wouldn't otherwise reach'<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:46)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (I guess it's hard to define that one)<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:57)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> New Caledonia isn't independent from France yet AFAIK (though they're interested in it!).  We've got a couple CHTC users from there! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(12:34:54)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Please don't create an international incident wrt Taiwan...<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:04:16)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I’ve seen the U.S. territories counted both ways (hopefully at different times). What is your goal?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:04:46)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> But in any case, yes, you should treat Puerto Rico and Guam similarly.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:45)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Put another way, are you trying to identify geography or nationality? Even the latter is tricky, but the U.S. territories are _not_ independent nations, for sure.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:41)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Heard a podcast a while back about American Samoa, whose residents don't get birthright American citizenship, but are considered American nationals...<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:30)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yeah.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:41)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I believe they are the only ones in that category.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:09)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> As usual, Wikipedia hits most of these points: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States</a><br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:38)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> But to Mark’s question … maybe we want to think about geopolitics just a little more carefully. I could see an argument for treating, say, Guam and Puerto Rico separately, because travel to/from them is harder than, say to/from Illinois or California.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:16)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> For example, there are no direct flights from Guam to the continental U.S.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:20)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Legally, or because we should also include Hawaii for also being really far away?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:27)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> PR is a little easier, of course.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Exactly — Hawaii and Alaska might be interesting for similar reasons.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:35)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> But how far down the rabbit-hole to go? There are places in, say, eastern Washington that are a real pain to travel from/to.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:45)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Anyway, I could see treating continental U.S. and then basically everything else separately, _*if*_ the main question is about facilitating connections that are often blocked by travel considerations.<br/>

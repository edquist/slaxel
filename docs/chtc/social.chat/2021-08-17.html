<span style="color: #84b22f"><span style="font-size: small">(07:58:46)</span> <b>ilandrum:</b></span> I didn’t know about Big Dogs Huge Paws, but I do now! From their site, they do not operate in WI, but will adopt outside of their region of ~6 states if you contact them and make it through their application process. <br/>
<span style="color: #84b22f"><span style="font-size: small">(08:11:09)</span> <b>ilandrum:</b></span> For the Great Dane (Rex who will be renamed to Loki) we are adopting in as short of a story as I can make it:<br/>• Owner wasn’t taking care of him<br/>• Loki was and still is grossly underweight<br/>• Our neighbors took him in and then asked us if we would take him after we put our dog, Tyr, down as they already have two dogs and one of their dogs was stealing Loki’s food<br/>
<span style="color: #84b22f"><span style="font-size: small">(08:12:30)</span> <b>ilandrum:</b></span> Loki is more of a fitting name for him as he can open doors and can reach on top of the fridge. He has helped himself to our dinner, the pantry, our baked goods, and has let himself out a couple of times… At least he doesn’t roam and listens when called<br/>

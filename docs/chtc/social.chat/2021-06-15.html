<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:08)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @jstathas Re HTCondor Fun Day signup - I have a small/portable charcoal grill and also a small gas grill (each fits about 5 burgers).  If there are no other grills there, I will plan to bring both.  If you think that is overkill, lemme know.<br/>

Brian was talking about bringing his home grill in his minivan, but that seemed to be more than what is needed if we have 3 more portable small ones.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:37)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> Roger that, I will bring both....<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(18:08:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Note that HTCondor Fun Day starts at 9am, and maybe we have the donuts for breakfast?<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:22:16)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> I bought a 24 pack of Spotted Cow and then came home to find my beer fridge died.  Anyone have spare fridge storage capacity?<br/>

<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:57)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> suuuure it is<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:50:06)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> I mean, it'll be 90 on Thursday so the 70 degree beer will feel somewhat cold...<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(19:37:17)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> @bbockelman if we can arrange a pickup tomorrow afternoon/evening, I have room in my beer fridge. It'll cool overnight and I can bring it Thursday morning.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(19:39:07)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Looks like Iâ€™m back-to-back until 4 tomorrow. Do you park on campus?  I can just keep it in my trunk.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(19:43:59)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I'm currently camping. I come back into town for my golf game.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(19:44:37)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Give me a call and let's work this out. 608 576 0351.<br/>

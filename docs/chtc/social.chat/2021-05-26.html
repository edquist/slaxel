<h3>Wed May 26, 2021 : #social (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:48:32)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> We are on the terrace on the “roof” of the cafeteria in middle of terrace. Where all the weddings overflow to. <br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:45:01)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> Here<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(17:39:51)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Leaving home now.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:06)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ETA 5:25 for me and Logan We will look for Mark<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:36)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:18:37)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> FYI I grabbed a table up on the roof since most of the other seating is taken!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:34)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> I am headed over now (eta 5:35), and I know Teresa is on her way as well. See folks soon! Mark post a photo were you are at <br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:51)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Let me know when you're ready to head over, I'm good to go anytime<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:15)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> If we’re drinking we don’t need masks and can sit at the same table(s).<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:54)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @coatsworth when we did the student thing, we were able to seat more peopl by getting multiple tables at least near each other. People can stand, move around, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:50)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> me too - was thinking of walking it over<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:49)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Sounds great Tim! Let me know when you're heading over. I've got my bike here but can also just walk it.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:02)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> I'm up for that, Mark<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:28)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> FYI I can't stick around the Terrace terribly long day today, so if anybody wants to meet earlier at 5pm let me know.<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:05)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> my mo with these things the last year has been go for it and find out if anyone really cares<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:19)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Any idea how this works? Is playing musical chairs frowned upon?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:10)</span> <b>coatsworth:</b></span> Question about the Terrace, I think tables are limited to 4 people and it already sounds like we'll have many more than that. We're not supposed to move chairs around.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:19)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I’m in for terracing tonight.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:39)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> you could also get a steinway grand for a cool 5k (which is actually probably a really good deal): <a href="https://swapauction.wisc.edu/Listing/Details/10423457/1960-Steinway-Grand-Piano-UWMadison">https://swapauction.wisc.edu/Listing/Details/10423457/1960-Steinway-Grand-Piano-UWMadison</a><br/>

<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:20)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> that piano looks great! especially since the pictures make it out to currently be used as a practice room piano.  Those things get beat up so much.<br/>
<span style="color: #4bbe2e"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:32)</span> <b>tjslauson:</b></span> wonder how many times it's had to move in the last 60 years...<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:26)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> if anyone is looking for a bike fixer-upper, swap has some (probably scavenged from campus bike racks?) for sale right now: <a href="https://swapauction.wisc.edu/Browse/C769694/BikesAccessories">https://swapauction.wisc.edu/Browse/C769694/BikesAccessories</a><br/>

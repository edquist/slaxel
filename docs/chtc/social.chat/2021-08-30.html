<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:34)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> &gt;  On Tuesday and Wednesday (8/31-9/1) UW’s Physical Plant will be conducting some vibration testing along Orchard St. and within adjacent buildings to provide data for the CDIS (Computer, Data and Information Sciences) building construction that is scheduled to begin next summer. The testing will utilize a large excavator to hit the ground numerous times while using sensors to record vibrations at different distances from the impact points. <br/>Man, I want the job of "hit ground with excavator and see what happens"!<br/>

One of his jobs was measuring how much shock a running hard drive could take before a head crash.<br/>

<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:16)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Chatting with Francesco, seems like most of Europe is waiting 12 weeks between covid vax doses<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:12)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Isn't that because they don't have enough?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:45)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah I was gonna say, is that based on supply issues<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:11)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Yes, and a choice to give more people some protections rather than fewer people full protection<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:14)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (The first dose is effective enough that dosing two people instead of one is better, epidemilogically (?) speaking.)<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:59)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I wonder if there’s enough data “in the wild” to get an idea of single dose effectiveness at this point for the vaccines that didn’t do clinical single dose studies<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:35)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I've seen numbers, but I don't recall if they're guesses or data. :)<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:55)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I’m pretty sure the studies right now are “shotgun” based on current practice.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:20)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> As someone who knows nothing of biology, I was a bit surprised that the 2 doses are identical<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:41)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Supposedly the Sputnik doses are not<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> which would make them more effective than the other adenovirus-based ones<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:03)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I wonder if thats an optimization for logistics, rather then for efficacy.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:22)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> @gthain I think it was a combination of that and testing simplicity.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:17)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (I've heard that they're looking at testing half-strength boosters, to help stretch supplies.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:22)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (er, second shots.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:31)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> ("Boosters" may be something else entirely, sadly.)<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:58)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> has anyone heard about the magnets sticking to injection sites?  i am curious if it's true<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(16:32:07)</span> <b>***matyas:</b></span> doesn't have a magnet handy<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:29)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I'm not driving back to Walgreens to see if a magnet sticks to it<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:17)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wheaties-cereal-sticks-to-magnets-because-it-iron/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wheaties-cereal-sticks-to-magnets-because-it-iron/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(16:36:50)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> But sadly, while Wheaties are magnetic, vaccines are not: <a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-dont-contain-magnetic-ingredients-dose-volume-is-too-small-to-contain-any-device-able-to-hold-a-magnet-through-the-skin/">https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-dont-contain-magnetic-ingredients-dose-volume-is-too-small-to-contain-any-device-able-to-hold-a-magnet-through-the-skin/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:33)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I did not know about the cereal thing, that's kinda cool!<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:09)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> this is the ONLY reason I would ever consider buying wheaties<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:31)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> is that why Michael Jordan was good at dunking a ball on a metal rim<br/>

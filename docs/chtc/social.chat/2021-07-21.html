<h3>Wed Jul 21, 2021 : #social (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:40:07)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> does anyone have home internet recommendations? I need to set up internet access at my new place and am feeling very suspicious about charter’s pricing scheme.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(08:46:59)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I've been happy with AT&amp;T Fiber.  Dunno about where it is available.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:45)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I'm on TDS Fiber in Middleton and very happy with it. I remember that TDS outside Middleton was something different in the past.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:27)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Isn’t there a distinction between TDS Metrocom (in Madison) and TDS Telecom (in the outlying communities, like Middleton and Verona)?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:53)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I was going to mention TDS, too, but I’m just not sure it’s the same thing — or available — inside Madison.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:59)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> There used to be a difference between them, but my impression is that it's pretty fully integrated by now.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:20:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Well, I second Tim T.’s review of TDS fiber — it’s been great and TDS has been easy to work with. No horror stories (for me) like ones I’ve read about with Charter.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:25)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> [sadness at not being able to get TDS fiber intensifies]<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:47)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I don’t think I can get TDS in Madison. :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:40)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> weird, I get spam from them all the time<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:48)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> My old house in Madison got TDS — if you are close enough to the fringes, the service areas are covered by TDS for historical reasons. E.g., my old house was far enough south and west that it historically belonged to the Verona CO, even after Madison annexed that land.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:04)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Mat, you may fall into the same situation.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> heh, maybe. Some of the houses near me have "Verona" on their trash cans<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:43)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Maybe that's just a description of how they feel about Verona?<br/>

<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:31)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Thieves!<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:01)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> <a href="https://tdstelecom.com/about/news/categories/tds/Super_high_speed_internet_expands_in_DaneCo.html">https://tdstelecom.com/about/news/categories/tds/Super_high_speed_internet_expands_in_DaneCo.html</a><br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> No map, but gives a gist of the service area.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:53)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> Madison is like a big hole in the middle of that list of names. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:13)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I can confirm that TDS isn’t available in much of Madison. My brother-in-law works there, but we can’t get service.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:20)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> that seems weird. Do you know why?<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:28)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> I do not know. I’ll ask him.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:07)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> changing tack slightly: if anyone needs something to do this Saturday between 10:30 - 1ish, I could use some moving help.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Cameron and I should be able to make it there at some point!<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:24)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> that would be SUPER helpful. :grin:<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:11)</span> <b>iross:</b></span> I can as well. Sarah's got a few other things on the schedule but might make an appearance a bit later, depending on how it goes<br/>

<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:04)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> House cooling party at the Koch residence?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:13)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I will hopefully have the A/C working by then. :joy:<br/>

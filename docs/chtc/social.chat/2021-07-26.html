<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:14)</span> <b>wiscmoate:</b></span> @jstathas I made it to Marigold Kitchen this weekend;  thanks for letting me know they're back open!<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> So, party at @tim â€™s tomorrow after work?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:44)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> Yup! In addition to what I mentioned in the email. Heather made plenty of potato salad. We'll also put out some homemade kimchi.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:14)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> We have hotdogs for any kids that show up.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:33)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> The ladder ball is set up. And I borrowed the bean bag toss from Jason. If many people show up, you might need to bring a folding chair to sit on.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:49)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Anything else we can/should bring?<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:38)</span> <b>tim:</b></span> I asked Heather and she said that don't really have a any desserts or fruits.<br/>

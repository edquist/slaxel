<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:16:43)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Turns out, sometimes an F-16 out the window is a _good_ thing. Thanks to @ilandrum for setting things up!<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:18:40)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> well now i am curious<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:19:17)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Really curious about the refueling picture -- I hadn't thought there was a window for the drogue.  Is that the operator's (?) station?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:19:55)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (I think that's the "drogue".  I think the bit on the plane, if there is one, is the "probe.")<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:20:11)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (... I have some things to check on Wikipedia, I guess.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:23:27)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Ah, apparently the KC-135s are out of Milwaukee.  I didn't recall seeing one at Truax.)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:23:50)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (... OK, apparently the KC-135s use the _other_ air-to-air refueling mechanism, which is called a "boom".)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:24:18)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Sadly, the "boom operator" is responsible for making things _not_ explode.)<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:24:40)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> i only know about the boom on sailboats<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:24:59)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> (it's named after the sound it makes when it hits your head)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:25:04)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Apparently they really do just have a big window: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_operator_(military)#/media/File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_operator_(military)#/media/File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:25:24)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> I was kind of expecting some extra gear for refueling at night and in bad weather.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(18:25:50)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> (Maybe at night they just use bright-enough lights, I guess.)<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(22:15:21)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> It’s a big window and it’s all done lying prone - there’s literally a chin rest since you might be there for awhile.  Apparently for the new KC-46, they switched to all VR helmet type displays and you sit up front. This -135, however, was from 1961 … so a window sufficed. Knowing what I know about computers, I’m not sure I’d trust 1,000 gallons of fuel a minute to a camera.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(23:13:25)</span> <b>tlmiller:</b></span> Fair point.<br/>
<span style="color: #d58247"><span style="font-size: small">(23:20:09)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> More legroom than Economy Plus!<br/>

<h3>Wed Aug 11, 2021 : #social (chtc)</h3>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:00:59)</span> <b>jbart:</b></span> It's all fun and games until the full grown kitties want to share your pillow.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(08:01:53)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> That sounds like our cats. They are banned from our bedroom at night because they will sleep in Lelah’s face, who is mildly allergic.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(08:04:29)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> Are the kids feeding the cats? That helps promote interest.<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:07:10)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> ah, I'll have to try the feeding idea.  Until then, I've found kitten party time is approximately 11:30pm and 5:00am.  lots of coffee.<br/>
<span style="color: #9b3b45"><span style="font-size: small">(08:51:36)</span> <b>jfrey:</b></span> They are crepuscular. (That’s a fun word to say)<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:34)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> Tornado watch issued until 8 PM <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2021/ww0424.html">https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2021/ww0424.html</a> (and associated mesoscale discussion for the weather nerds: <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md1478.html">https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md1478.html</a> )<br/>

<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(12:34:48)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> unofficially, I would be pretty concerned with anything that were to develop between La Crosse and Prairie du Chien and points eastward<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:25)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> (i.e. if I was still into storm chasing, that’s where I’d be set up today…)<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:47)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I don’t understand all of the meteorology jargon in there, but I get the gist of it. Yikes.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:29)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> SPC just put out another MD <a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md1483.html">https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md1483.html</a><br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:33)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What is MLCAPE? (Both an expansion, plus maybe some plain English…)<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:30)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> ML = Mid-level, CAPE = convectively available potential energy... It's a measure of how strong storm updrafts could be once the warm air at/near the ground starts getting lifted. A positive difference between the temperature of lifted air parcels and the temperature of the ambient air (i.e. lifted air warmer than environment) contributes to CAPE. Values &gt; 1000 J/kg are indicative of a severe weather threat<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:20)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I’m not exactly sure how mid-level is defined here, I could probably find out<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:41)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> OH! It’s not “mid-level”, it’s “mixed-layer”<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:47)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> :facepalm:<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:11)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> the mixed layer being the turbulent boundary layer in about the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:34)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> so instead of using surface temperature to compute CAPE, they’re using the mean (potential) temperature of the mixed layer<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:30)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> (generally speaking, the mean potential temperature of the mixed layer is going to be pretty close to the surface temperature)<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:26)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Awesome, great explanation, thanks!<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:03)</span> <b>ckoch5:</b></span> I think I may take the bus home early and plan to hunker down.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(18:48:09)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> welp, tornado warning coming through<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:48:22)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> Hope everyone just saw the tornado warning for our area!  We are playing Mario Kart in the basement.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(18:55:49)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> rotation dissipated quickly after the storm crossed the border into Dane :+1::+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(18:56:35)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> is it ok to go 'yay' or is it too early?<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:56:47)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> I’m … ok with that. Even if it means I have to lose at Mario in the meantime <br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(18:57:40)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I think lightning is the only threat now :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:58:28)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> (FWIW, it did seem like the wind was blowing west in my front yard and to the east I. The back.  I’ll take lightning for now)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(18:58:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> the wind is ~almost~ completely still where I am<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(19:04:52)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> I think we got lucky with a little cloud cover from some storms that popped north of us around 4:30, right when surface temperatures should peak<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(19:06:06)</span> <b>jcpatton:</b></span> One thing I learned while chasing in college is never discount the impact of a little pre-main event cloud cover, had many chases "bust" from early clouds<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(19:24:43)</span> <b>bbockelman:</b></span> In the meantime… not impressed!<br/>

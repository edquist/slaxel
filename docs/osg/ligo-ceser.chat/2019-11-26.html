<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:10)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @paschos, actually i've been a little tied up and i hadn't had a chance to submit the requested jobs, sorry.  There was the large batch of BayesWave jobs from user sudarshan.ghonge, which probably have some useful data.  Planning to get to the more targeted jobs after i finish writing a talk<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:00)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> I saw the submitted job ids you posted last week. they didn't run?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:25)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> yeah... the user: sudarshan.ghonge<br/>

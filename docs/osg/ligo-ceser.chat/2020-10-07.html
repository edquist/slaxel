<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:25)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> @james.clark @efajardo<br/>Has /cvmfs/ligo-containers.opensciencegrid.org been deprecated?<br/>I was mounting it in PRP, but is failing now (and does nott seem to be available on the UCSD UAF either)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:16)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> it has been replaced by the standard osg repo.  i am not aware of anyone still (trying) to use it (if they are, they're not reporting any problems and it hasn't been updated for a long time).  It should be ok to unmount it.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:10)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> ok, good to know…<br/>although it would have been nice if someone told me that :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:30)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> right, sorry!  there's been a bit of discussion over the past few wees about shutting down the publishing mechanisms which evidently distracted us from *where* they were being published<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:12)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> I will raise this tomorrow but i'm quite certain no one running at PRP will be trying to access any of those paths<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:06)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> It just had a nasty side effect of basically break all of our CVMFS setup (since that mounpoint was labeled as required)…<br/>I guess I have to make it less fragile :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:15)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> ok, yes, those labels are definitely out of date, it's not even available at caltech...<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:17)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> when was it replaced?<br/>

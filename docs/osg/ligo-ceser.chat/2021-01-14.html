<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:57)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> <b>@channel</b>, i'm going to need to skip today - my home connection is unstable and need to get to the office.  My main update is that i'm working on retrying a data transfer to Hannover but it's surprisingly difficult to clear a backlog of old fts jobs.  Finally getting to the RIFT rsv demo today, too (apologies for the delay on this)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:40)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:59)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> we can chat over slack<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:15)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> sometimes later or tomorrow<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:57)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> I am sorry<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:03)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> I actually forgot about this meeting<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:37:58)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> @paschos, finally finished (hopefully) setting up the RIFT jobs (turns out i was 90% of the way there well before christmas..).   I cleaned things up, made them submit file-only (no DAG) and threw them in a git-lfs repo since one of them includes a pair of frame files, just in case we need examples which do not rely on cvmfs data: <a href="https://git.ligo.org/james-clark/rift-use-cases/-/tree/master/rsv">https://git.ligo.org/james-clark/rift-use-cases/-/tree/master/rsv</a>.   You can just use the "download this directory" button on the gitlab UI to get everything you need btw.<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:38:48)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Let me know if you want to tune the run time: they should be ~30 minutes<br/>

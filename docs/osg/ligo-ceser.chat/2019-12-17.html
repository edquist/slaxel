<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:50)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> hi all.. there are some conflicts today for the regular time. I'll be online with @jhicks at 4 central... feel free to join then. <a href="http://bit.ly/rwg-zoom">bit.ly/rwg-zoom</a><br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:26)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Sorry, i haven't been getting notifications properly on this channel for some reason. I can probably join today.<br/>• Regarding more useful BayesWave output info: that's something i've wanted to get to for a while..  isn't some of that information already present in the classad, though?<br/>• Re the additional script: iirc, the condor job which currently runs calls the executable directly.  I guess the easiest thing to do is provide @efajardo with a wrapper which runs both of these?    <br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:29)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hi <b>@channel</b> now my rucio setup is more or less stable, i can set up those production-like bayeswave RSV jobs.    Just want to check the requirements:<br/>1. do we still want 8x the same job + different data, or do we just want a single production-like job?   Bear in mind these will take anywhere from ~12-48 hours, depending on the exact setup.<br/>2. How long / what's the maximum desirable run time?   Even in production mode, there are still a few different configurations.   I can at least start with the most common type of OSG-deployed job, though<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:18)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> 1. single. it will be infrequent enough that data access is irrelevant<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:47)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> 2. 24 hours ...<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:07)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hey @efajardo, @paschos, Peter's asking around to see if anyone would like to present anything for LIGO at condor week.  I'm happy enough to present but i'm having a hard time thinking of anything really new or new user experiences.   Are you planning to present anything, or can you think of anything you'd like to see presented ?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:12)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Well I do not have much to present to be honest<br/>

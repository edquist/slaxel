Contains a 1-job DAG and a bash script with the equivalent command line (assuming you start in the singularity container from the submit file).  RIFT is currently only deployed in singularity so I think this is it for now.  Reads frame data from CVMFS and it ran in about 15 mins on the CIT GPU test node.<br/>

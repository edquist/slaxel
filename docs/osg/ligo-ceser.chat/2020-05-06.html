<h3>Wed May 6, 2020 : #ligo-ceser (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:51:49)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Ok, for the RSV jobs: I've set up a couple of production-like jobs which run the kind of analysis the vast majority of our BayesWave OSG submissions do.   I'm going to let some current submissions run to completion so we know for sure what these exact jobs look like under normal operation.  Some notes / questions:<br/>1. I just turned off the <tt>transfer_output_files</tt> and discovered that condor ships back the entire sandbox in the absence of any specifically requested files.  This comes to something like 100 MB - is that ok, or shall i add a PostCmd to clean up?<br/>2. Do we want the jobs to checkpoint?   Currently, BayesWave does an hourly periodic checkpoint and exits (and condor knows to restart by the exit code).  Are the RSV jobs guarenteed to resume in the same place, or shall i just disable this?<br/>3. Again, i set up a conda and a singularity version - @paschos mentioned some evidence for a difference in efficiency, so i'd be interested in running both, if we can<br/>(I'm going offline for an hour or so, will check in later)<br/>

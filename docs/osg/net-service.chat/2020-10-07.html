<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @smckee I can't find any production throughput tests with psum02 as the "src_host".  Is that node not enabled (or wasn't on Oct. 1-2) for production throughput tests?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:35)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> psum02 or psmsu02 ?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> psum02<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:34)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> That is the one I was working to debug and its problems are why I wanted to move to using psmsu01/02...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:22)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, then I don't think I ever received any data that wasn't from psum02.  So, psmsu01/02 never worked as far as I can tell.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:48)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> OK, I am pinging Philippe at MSU to reboot them...<br/>

<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:17:59)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> @dweitzel can you document the current RabbitMQ -&gt; ESmond data process?  I will need to include slides in my AC meeting on Dec 2.   The other thing I will need is details on the recovery from toolkits replay and current problems.  Anything you can provide would be helpful.<br/>

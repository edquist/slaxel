<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(21:12:16)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> As for a networking pipeline update.  Luckly we have 2 sets of ingesters for Chicago, one at nebraska and one at Wisconsin (k8s).  So ingestion into Chicago is still going on.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(21:14:11)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Also, the tape archiving is on pause for now. The archive queue was getting rather large, close to 4 Mil.  There is no limit on the archive queue, so it would have just continued forever.  I started an archiver on another node.  It won't backup to tape, but it will store the data and relieve pressure on the message bus.<br/>

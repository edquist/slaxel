<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:09:22)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> So that information is not available in what is put on the bus from pScheduler, right?   Perhaps Andy Lake can comment on what to do there?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:09:47)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> In general, we don't really need the MA but it is useful to track/verify where the data is coming from.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:51)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> This may take a while to reconcile the differences between production and test.  Comparing the exact same 1 hour period:<br/><pre>  Production Records    Test Records    In production, not test    In test not production<br/>--------------------  --------------  -------------------------  ------------------------<br/>               22524           26828                       5830                     10134</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:58)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> That's not sounding good.   Any high level insights into the 10134 vs 5830 ?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Not really.  I tried limiting it to only between psmsu01 and OU, didnt' really have a lot of insights there.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:58)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Right now, I have packet loss only being collected from latency tests.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:10)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Do you think normally it also gathers it from throughput tests?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:54)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Packet loss is *only* gathered by latency tests and retransmits are only gathered from throughput tests<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:14)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Maybe better to say that a latency test measures both one-way delay (OWD) and packet-loss, while a throughput test measures both achievable bandwidth and restransmits<br/>

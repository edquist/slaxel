<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:57)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Got postgres monitoring running again on hcc-ps01.<br/>It was kinda hackish, but working. I had to edit the mk_postgres script a bit to stop using UTF8 _things_ in queries along with using a newer version of the script.<br/><br/><pre>ERROR:  Unicode escape values cannot be used for code point values above 007F when the server encoding is not UTF8 at or near "E'[\n\r\u2028"</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:57)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Ahh, excellent — I had nuked the old checkmk checks for it (since they were failing/missing) and made a note to ask you about it today. You beat me to it. Procrastination ftw! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-15 11:43:15)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Hmm. We were at 100 connections, with most of them <tt>postgres: pscheduler pscheduler [local] idle</tt>. Looking at the graph, I suspect max_connections was higher before the reinstall. I bumped it to 500.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-15 12:27:11)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Thanks John, the node does lots of testing and I guess needed tweaking.   Is there something "custom" about the postgresql install on this node?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-15 12:28:11)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> There shouldn’t be — it was quite literally a fresh install from the 4.4.0 netinstall ISO a few days back<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-07-15 12:28:47)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> beyond adding back the mesh configs, SSH keys, and putting the node info back into the webpage (lat/long/communities/etc) I didn’t modify anything.<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @thomlee, @mvkrenz: have you fixed something on your end? Because now graccarchive@ps-itb service contacting event-itb work flawless!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:43)</span> <b>thomlee:</b></span> I haven't done anything particularly, but it's been rebooted since last time we talked ... could that have done something?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not sure, but IPv6 issue seen from strace is gone<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:17)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> I have been working on it today<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:43)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> I have tried to bring up the previous VM to see the differences<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:56)</span> <b>thomlee:</b></span> Well I'm glad the issue is gone, but if we don't know what caused it, we should be on the lookout for it to come back<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:32)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> so I rebooted a VM a couple of times. right now we have the one we has issues with<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:18)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> I have also created a rabbitmq client trying to recreate the issue. But I was able to connect to event-itb<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:51)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so was there any obvious difference between the VMs? (other than previous was working and is still working and new one is working now without changes?)<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:28)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> RabbitMQ 3.6.6, Erlang 19.0.4<br/>RabbitMQ 3.6.10, Erlang 19.3.6.2<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:43)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> the first one was on the previous VM and the last one is on the current<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> where VMs on the same network too?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:24)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> I also took out stomp plugin and tested and put it back in.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:38)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> VMs are on the same server<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so is now that RabbitMQ 3.6.10 and Eralng 19.3.6.2 is happily serving stuff?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:01)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> on the current event-itb<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so perphaps something was in weird state<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> one of the solar flares effects we might probably never understand unless it appears again as an issue<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:26)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> well I rebooted rabbitmq-server before<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:04)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> but this time I was brining down the actual VM. So it must have reset it.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks Marina!<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:41)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> no problem. I will keep an eye on it<br/>

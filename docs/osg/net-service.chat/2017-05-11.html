<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(13:20:24)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Hi Soichi, good suggestion.   I tried to do just that on psds1 two days ago.   I reconfigured to stop recovery and start postgresql normally.   I get the same kind of problems on the psds1 instance :disappointed:      The last time the DBs worked was April 24 (when the disk upgrade was started).   It could be the psds2 could work but I didn't want to mess with it.   I suspect that for psds1, it also may have been corrupted by the disk upgrade copy process OR the hot-standby replicated some "bad" information to the slave servers.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:35)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Notice for everyone.  I now have a block of time to try to install Postgresql 9.6.x on psds0 and migrate all the data I can from 9.4.11 (the current version) into the new one.  To do this I will shut-down and move the 9.4 instance into a version specific directory, reconfigure to use that directory and change the postgresql port to 5433 from 5432.   The new version of Postgresql will use the standard port.  Thing will be intermittent until I am done installing/moving.   I will try to document all the steps and changes.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:49)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> OK as of 5:13 PM the psds0 database is back online with what I could salvage from psds1 (psds0 was too messed up).   Data is flowing again to CERN.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:23)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> I am running some updates on psds0 and then will reboot to get all in place.  Next up will be recreating the hot-standby config on psds1 and psds2 (tomorrow).<br/>

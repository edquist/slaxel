<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(06:25:04)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Hi Ajit,  try your 'curl -6' tests again.   I think the problem was on the UM side and it should be resolved.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:25)</span> <b>akmohapatra:</b></span> Thanks Shawn ! Yes, it is working now. Good to know that the issue wasn't on our side, since our (physics dept) network experts were very confident about it, after I discussed the issue with them.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:24)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> I see your instance has lots of test results.  Glad it is working.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:07)</span> <b>akmohapatra:</b></span> @smckee yes, it's back now. For my knowledge, what exactly was the IPv6 issue on the UM side and the source/cause ?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:01)</span> <b>akmohapatra:</b></span> and was our site the only one affected ?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:37)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> CFengine had a bad config for ip6tables.   I had manually fixed things previously but CFengine reverted to an incorrect config<br/>

If that loss happens during your tests it could impact your results significantly.   However, I think the main issue is the power of the CPU driving the transfer.   You might be able to tune some of the offloading provided by the NIC using 'ethtool'.   Try 'ethtool -k eth0' or whatever your 100G interface is ('em1', 'p1p2', etc)<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> If you can hit 28Gbps in Xrootd before they can fix things, then we'll consider that a win.<br/>

<h3>Wed Mar 13, 2019 : #net-service (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:16:27)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> @dweitzel even with the timeout and rework we currently have two hosts with 0 queries and quite a few with many "failures in the last hour" (many are at 12 which would be failing each 5 minutes in an hour).  What I don't understand is that the old RSV probe seems to be getting data for the nodes we are having issues with (in many cases).<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:18:23)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> We could try to put the new system in production and shutdown the RSV perfSONAR processes.  The thought is that maybe it is query load related?  Maybe the new system would work better if the old one is no longer loading the end-hosts.   (I am not convinced this is the issue though since some of the end-hosts are pretty powerful and still have hanging sockets).<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:02:10)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I re-worked how the processes are handled, with hopefully better timeouts.<br/>

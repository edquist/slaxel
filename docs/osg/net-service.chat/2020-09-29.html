<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @smckee turn on the test push data again!  I only received traceroute, owdelay, and throughput data.  I didn't get retransmits or packet loss rate.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> You don't think that the retransmits and packet loss rate are derived from one of the other tests?  Maybe throughput?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:53)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Retransmits should come from throughput and packet loss from owdelay<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:04:57)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> huh... the logstash templates from perfsonar team don't seem to have that.  deep diving...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:18)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> their logstash seems to indicate that there is a separate "rtt" test.<br/>

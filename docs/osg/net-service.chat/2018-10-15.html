<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:23:55)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> There's nothing much to do about it right now.  Last night, Marian B. received an alert that PS status data wasn't not being received.  He restarted the collectors here at nebraska, and it started working again...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> So we get some alerts @bbockelm<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Anyone know how to get more people on those email alerts?  Is MarianB the only one getting those?<br/>

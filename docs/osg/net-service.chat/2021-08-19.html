<h3>Thu Aug 19, 2021 : #net-service (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @smckee INDIS extended their deadline to Sept. 5.  But would we benefit from 2 more weeks?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:09)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> I don't think so.  Better to submit and get feedback from reviewers sooner (though that may not happen)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I don't think that will happen any faster if we submit faster.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, submitted.  We are paper: "ws_indis101s1".  I doubt they have had 100 submissions before us, so I think we are the first submission!<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:34)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>

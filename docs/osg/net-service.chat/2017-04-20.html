<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:33:16)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> @steige I wasn't able to invite Tom.  If he needs to contact me on Slack or wants to post questions/info during the upgrade tomorrow, this would be a good channel<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(08:35:43)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> FYI: Tomorrow (Friday, April 21) we will finally be starting the OSG datastore upgrade.  There are 3 RAID-10 areas, each with 4 disks that will be upgrade sequentially.   We are going from 4TB to 8TB  disks.   The <a href="http://psvm01.grid.iu.edu">psvm01.grid.iu.edu</a> host (running all the "production" OSG net services) will need to be rebooted each time we  upgrade one of the 3 arrays.   Work will likely need to extend to next week (can't be on Monday/Tuesday).<br/>

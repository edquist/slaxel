<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:55)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> FYI, seems to be more issues with the UC Elasticsearch instance...I am getting emails the cluster state is "[ES in red]"<br/>
<span style="color: #84b22f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:08)</span> <b>ivukotic:</b></span> yes. me too.<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:38)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> I am scared to upgrade ours from 7.2.0 to 7.4.x now :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #84b22f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:49)</span> <b>ivukotic:</b></span> everybody is...<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:29)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Guess we will stay at 7.2.0 for a while<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:00)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Had they just done that? We’ve got 7.2 as well (not the one OSG uses) and I was literally just thinking of updating minutes ago…<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:39)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> UC went from 6.8.0 to 7.3 originally...and started having "issues"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:29)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @smckee - we don't have "issues", we have "opportunities for fun"!<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:49)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Fun times then!<br/>

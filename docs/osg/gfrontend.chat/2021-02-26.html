<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:49)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> @james.clark The starter would need to set SINGULARITY to /cvmfs/something, so you can't set that in the job<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:07)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> Is there a way to get the StarterLog for one of these sites?<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:14)</span> <b>gthain:</b></span> I had thought that the glidein returned these logs to the factory<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:21)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> I'm talking to @maryh just now to see what we can pull out of Nikhef directly but the only thing i have access to is the submit machine (also, nikhef is no longer showing up in our pool at all)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 @marian ^^^ can you guys setup a log rsync for IGWN as is done for CMS, OSG, and CHTC?<br/>

<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:33)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I"m sure this exists somewhere ... is there some way to figure out an appropriate HTTP proxy within a job running in the global pool?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you mean what proxy a job is using?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:44)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Yeah, if I land @ a site and want to grab some things via HTTP, is there a way to determine what I should use for a proxy<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:29)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Env variables <tt>http_proxy</tt> or <tt>OSG_SQUID_LOCATION</tt>, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ya, assuming that the job passed through an htcondor-ce<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:06)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Is that consistently set somewhere? (IIRC, we don't have those set @ Vanderbilt, at least not explicitly)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:50)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <tt>osg-configure</tt> should write it out to <tt>/var/lib/osg/osg-job-environment.conf</tt>, which HTCondor-CE picks up and passes along<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:16)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I would personally nudge you toward <tt>http_proxy</tt> as that's a commonly-used variable not grid-specific (which also has its drawbacks, mind you)<br/>

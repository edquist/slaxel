<h3>Fri Jul 26, 2019 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:17)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> There is this line 'consider_as_osg=yes' in /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-development.repo. Is it coming from OSG? If so, what is it for?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think you've got an old version of <tt>osg-release</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Nothing anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it was added in OSG 3.0, no idea why. we removed it in osg-release-3.4-5<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> We used to have a yum plugin that would remove all the osg packages<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (it's probably one of those things that people asked for but never used)<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:33)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> So, it was blocking new package visibility. I guess I could remove it.<br/>

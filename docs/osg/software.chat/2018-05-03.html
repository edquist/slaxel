<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:03)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <b>@here</b> - OASIS was migrated to Nebraska earlier today; all appears to work just fine.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:19)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> however, if you're an OASIS manager, please go kick the tires.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:21)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> including our tarballs?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:43)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> What do you mean by that, Mat?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:02)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> did @tim.theisen try the release process for uploading our tarballs to the new OASIS?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:18)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (I guess that was pre-migration, but still)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:40)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I think this is the first heâ€™s heard that the migration is finished<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> don't know if he tested out oasis-itb, but I didn't hear any requests to halt or for extra time.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Would be a good time to test as all the experts are available.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:51)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @zalak - any updates on a testing OSG-CA bundle?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:04)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> It's ongoing. Sorry, the instructions in the document is not so clear.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:07)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Have you ever included a non-IGTF CA before in the CA Distribution?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> as long as I've been part of the OSG, the security team has done the CA distributions so I'm not sure there's any expertise on the S&amp;R team :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:41)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Ah! Okay.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:23)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yes - the first time that we _didn't_ include a non-IGTF CA was very recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:38)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> The FNAL KCA was never IGTF and that was included for &gt;5 years.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:00)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Okay.<br/>

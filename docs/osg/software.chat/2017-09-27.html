<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:32)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> With DES jobs I have been seeing a ton of issues with xrdcp commands out of FNAL dCache. I can reproduce it when setting up v 3.3.28 of the OSG stack, which is xrootd 4.7.0. We see a bunch of authorization failures or the dCache mover will just hang indefinitely. Killing the copy, setting up xrootd 4.6.1, and immediately trying to copy the same file works like a charm.<br/>

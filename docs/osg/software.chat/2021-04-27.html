<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(07:26:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @bbockelm <b>@edquist</b> @matyas @tim.theisen my router died last night so I have to run out and get a new one. Let's skip the tech area meeting this morning<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(07:27:19)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> OK. I recently uprade to an ASUS router and been very happy with it.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(07:27:45)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> My old Netgear router got flakey after a firmware update.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(07:29:16)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> @blin My old netgear could tide you over. Do you want it?<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(07:30:11)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> The issue it had was my LinuX laptop would lose connection when there were too many Zoom connections.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(07:33:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Yeah, actually that'd be nice until I can figure out a long term replacement<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(07:55:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin - sent out a cancellation email (I'm similarly in meetings this morning).<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:36:38)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> check for blown caps! thats how they die often<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:37:14)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> then you can be like me and spend $100 on a nice soldeirng iron so you can replace 10c worth of caps :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Maybe! One of my cats likes to sleep on it so I figured it overheated. We'll see what the damage is when I open it up<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:17:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face: We had our inventory folks put asset tag stickers ... over a new server's exhaust vent.  Caught that one before powering it, at least.<br/>

<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:22:28)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Speaking of Globus -- looks like they're gonna try again to give us their pitch @ SuperComputing. Anyone happen to use their Globus Online service?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:33)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Nebraska (HCC) has a globus plus subscription.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:06:31)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Whats your experience with the sysadmin side of it (if any)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:08:37)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @gattebury may know more of that side.  But we had to make modifications to their myproxy implementation to add duo 2-factor.  But other than that, I think it's mostly install and forget.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:58)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Nice. It's something that's been asked for, but we're reluctant to add, especially since they're dropping DSI support<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:41)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> so they only support posix filesystems now?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:12)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> For the record I’ve not had any experience with it from the sysadmin standpoint — if you want I can find out who did here @ Nebraska and have them contact you.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:57)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'm not 100% that they're only supporting posix filesystems, they may be folding the support for filesystems into the product itself instead of exporting an api<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'll keep that in mind, Garhan. I won't be the one installing it, but I'll chat with the others :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I think they aren’t supporting DSI because they want you to do a top-up contract for them to maintain it.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:26:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> E.g., they’ve offered to maintain dCache integration for a price.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:28:24)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> They did the same for LStore at last year's SC and we told them to kick rocks. I think they're sufficiently motivated (read: need the money) to keep a stable API if that'll get our business<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> <b>@here</b>: do we have an online "viewer" which lists scheduled downtime once entered via new procedure at <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/common/registration/#registering-resource-downtimes">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/common/registration/#registering-resource-downtimes</a> ?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> or perhaps it's the question to #osg-ops, I think<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> redirecting there...<br/>

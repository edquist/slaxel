<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:51)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @blin I believe so, yes. Nothing is listening on port 8443 for that server.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:55)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Koji is confusing me. Two builds of xrootd are both tagged into osg-3.3-el7-development. But only the most recent build (with an older NVR) is showing up in the repo. I had the idea that all tagged builds would show up in a repo. It's only the latest?<br/>- <a href="https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/koji/buildinfo?buildID=11637">https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/koji/buildinfo?buildID=11637</a><br/>- <a href="https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/koji/buildinfo?buildID=11601">https://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/koji/buildinfo?buildID=11601</a><br/>- <a href="http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/el7/development/x86_64/">http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/el7/development/x86_64/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:22)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> that's only true for the release repo<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:40)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> not development or testing<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> do you need the newest? (most recent nvr?)<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:32)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @matyas Ah, gotcha. I didn't realize the behavior differed between repos. Was going to install a particular test build for @marian, and was confused what was going on. I'll grab the rpms from koji. Thank you!<br/>

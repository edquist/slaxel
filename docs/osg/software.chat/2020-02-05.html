<h3>Wed Feb 5, 2020 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:29)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @u0928244 What is the operating system on your HPC nodes?  RHEL7 with fusermount installed also has a possibility of running cvmfs as an unprivileged user with <a href="https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/cvmfsexec">https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/cvmfsexec</a>.  This also requires support from the pilot which has not yet been done, but GlideinWMS (used by CMS &amp; OSG) is planning to support it.  Unlike the singularity 3.4+ --fusemount option, this does not require a container image to be preloaded on a local filesystem.<br/>
<span style="color: #619a4f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:09)</span> <b>u0928244:</b></span> They are RHEL7. I’ll run this by folks today.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:13)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Oh cool. The fusermount command comes in the fuse package.  An additional requirement is enabling unprivileged user namespaces, which is not enabled by default on RHEL7 but can be enabled with a sysctl setting.<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:15)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> So, I am having a bit of fun with Gridftp and LVS. It is tricky to debug because the gridftp server is working, I can transfer files in an out directly<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:53)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> LVS for gridftp always seemed like a huge amount of trouble <br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:06)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> It is a bit tricky,<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:20)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I just use HAproxy<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:21)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Mostly works perfect, but I want to add more doors so relearning some stuff<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:32)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Not going to switch, and there is OSG documenation on this<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:12)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> That's a brian-ism that continued :) its way too much effort compared to just round-robining the control channels around<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:26)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> At least we can toss it all this year when everyone drops gridftp :)<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:47)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Alas, that software has its own personality traits that can be grumpy, the replacement I mean.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> yeah xrootd is a catastrophe<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:35)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I don't understand how that's where we landed as a replacement<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:42)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Hey now, LVS gridftp is trivial! (_once you spend the requisite 8 months staring at tcpdump output convincing yourself it can work_)… _twitch_<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @andrew.melo - you can always run HTTPS on nginx if you want to poke the auth stack!  I'm trying to trick the Italians into writing a plugin to do the TPC pieces.<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:56)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> It is just weird, I mean my lcmaps.db file was all sorts of confused, but I was still able to auth? I thought maybe I found it when I found data_interface in the gridftp-hdfs was not set, nope...<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:36)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> lcmaps is not even logging on the host, so was it even being triggered? How was I able to transfer as me then directly?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:44:47)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> HCC's voms cert DN is changing.  I presume that will take a change in the voms (vo-client) package?<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:41)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> I figured it out.  The issue was the gsi-authz.conf file and lcmaps.db. Both were not configured correctly, but some how my user was able to write to the storage from the command line. That positive test, while all other writes were failing, was the source of the confusion.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:39)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> @bbockelm hindsight, etc, etc, but xrootd...<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:04)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Gridftp has its very big shortcomings, but it works and I don't have to screw with it 1/100th that i do with xrootd, and when I get a ggus, it's actually fixable instead of just shrugging and restarting the service<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:20)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Have you ever seen this error Andrew?<br/><br/>gfal-copy error: 70 (Communication error on send) - globus_xio: System error in send: Connection reset by peer globus_xio: A system call failed: Connection reset by peer<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:36)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> That is a direct connection, not through LVS<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:54)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> The host seems to work with IPv6, but fails with IPv4<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre><br/>The xrootd service at all CMS US Tier-2 sites seem to have failed authentication for certificates proxied between 2 am and 3 am UTC<br/>Sunday (Saturday evening US times). It looks to me like a daylight-savings<br/>bug, i.e. xrootd (or the authentication service used by it in OSG installations)<br/>applying the daylight-savings change based on UTC instead of local time.<br/>But this is a guess.<br/>OSG sites outside the US (i.e. Brazil) didn't show the problem. Neither did<br/>the failure show at Fermilab where the authentication/authorization check<br/>is done at the dcache level.<br/>Could you please take a look/check certificate time handling for xrootd?<br/></pre><br/>

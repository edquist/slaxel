<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:07:36)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> How much would cloudflare be mad if we put their CDN in front of an xrootd cache that spoke http?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(08:16:35)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> Talk to Dave Dykstra… he is doing something that sounds similar for CVMFS globally<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(08:16:52)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> @dwd ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:28:30)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> CVMFS is nice because it chunks files into manageable sizes<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:46)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> @andrew.melo we tried something like this a few years ago, the problem ended up being that all of the network traffic would take &amp; saturate commercial routes out of campus instead of Internet2/ESNet :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:05:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Like from the origin server to the CDN or CDN to client? Still a bummer<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:06:01)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> right, it wasn't xroot in that case but yeah.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:07:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Both directions?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:58)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @lincoln @andrew.melo Yeah Cloudflare probably wouldn’t be too mad about it.  Not everybody has Internet2/ESNet so it might make sense to use for them.  It would be a challenge to autoconfigure though.<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @dwd do you know how to read the WLCG squid monitoring charts?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:18)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Yes, what do you want to know<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> WSU has two FQDNs for its squid, one for external monitoring and the other internal to the cluster<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and they're noting that requests have gone to zero after this change (?): <a href="http://wlcg-squid-monitor.cern.ch/snmpstats/mrtgall/OSG_US_WSU_GRID_vsquid1.grid.wayne.edu/index.html">http://wlcg-squid-monitor.cern.ch/snmpstats/mrtgall/OSG_US_WSU_GRID_vsquid1.grid.wayne.edu/index.html</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the in/out graphs seem to be showing some activity but the other graphs have seen dropoffs<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what's in/out?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:43)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> That’s the plot for amount of data transfer.  ‘In’ is the data read from upstream and ‘Out’ is the output from the squid cache.  The difference is because of caching<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:34)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> That plot shows a normal pattern from mid-May to mid-August and appears to be essentially unused since then<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:57)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> There was probably only one or two requests during those couple peaks of In/Out today that don’t show a corresponding Request/Fetch, because the average over 5 minutes would be 0 requests.  There are only 252 objects total in the cache after having been up for 34 days<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> interesting, thanks<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> &gt;  ISRG and IdenTrust reached out to our auditors and root programs to review this plan and ensure there weren’t any compliance concerns. <br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh, well then<br/>

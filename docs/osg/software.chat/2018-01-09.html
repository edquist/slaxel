<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin - Looking through yesterday's meeting notes.  For the Oklahoma support issue, what's the ticket (JIRA and upstream?)?  It seems clear it's a systemd tmpfiles.d-type issue.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Also, I enjoy the fact that we're bikeshedding Google's professional UI designers.<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we gave horst the systemd-tmpfiles stuff, @marian's going to pass it upstream to xrootd<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and yea, i gave up on that UI redesign<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> the upstream ticket is closed and marked as resolved in a current release.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> in fact ... the release Horst is running.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i agree with your comment<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:19)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> yeah, the upstream fix clearly conflicts with their default configuration file.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it seems like the fix they implemented was half baked<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:50)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> or, if you're an optimist, incomplete<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> anyhow, time to run.  Good luck!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @blin, @bbockelm re Oklahoma -- yes, I wrote email directly to xrootd developer yesterday (to Michal Kamil Simon) and asked what is preferred way to go since it indeed seems like they didn't fully address the issue previously ... no answer yet, let's see what I get in the next day(s) ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (I made comment also to GOC ticket, for everybody else to know)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(20:25:04)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Let's also keep a record in the xrootd ticketing system so we can all stay on the same page.<br/>

<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:08)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> Hey @bbockelm, I was talking to a co-worker of mine who is working on some Elasticsearch stuff here, and he (and I) wanted to get ahold of you to perhaps just discuss what kind of stuff you're doing with it/working on over there with it in regards to condor. Miron seemed interested in it so if you have any time to maybe give us a brief summary or share some code or something like that, that'd be really cool.<br/>

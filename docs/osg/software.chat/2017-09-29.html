<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:01)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> @matyas we just spent some time trying to figure out why our IPv6 LVS GridFTP setup at Nebraska broke after some upgrades. In particular we had the globus-gridftp-server-control-5.2-1.1.osg33.el7 (yeah, out of -testing). Downgrading it to globus-gridftp-server-control-4.1-1.3.osg33.el7 seems to have resolved our issues, and looking at the package changelog I noticed the following : <pre>* Tue Aug 22 2017 Mátyás Selmeci &lt;matyas@cs.wisc.edu&gt; - 5.1-1.1.osg<br/>- Merge OSG changes<br/>  - Drop ipv6-load-balancing.patch</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:54)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> what was the motivation for that? I’ll be honest we haven’t exhaustively tested what is really wrong with the latest packages and our environment (power outage today … other things to fix). We can certainly look into this further next week, most of us are about done for the day here.<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:40)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Just wanted to bring it up noting the latest builds may break IPv6 LVS setups — probably whatever that patch fixed didn’t really get fixed in the mainline code all the way<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:51)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Hi @gattebury, I dropped that patch because the underlying code had changed enough that the patch no longer applied. It _looked_ like the changes had a similar effect as the patch, but I was worried that my analysis would be inaccurate -- which it apparently was.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(17:02:38)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Hi @matyas It looks like the globus-gridftp-server-control-epsv-ip.patch made the fix into a gridftp.conf option. We'll give it a try:<br/><pre>epsv_ip 1</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(18:52:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Sounds good. If it works, is there any reason not to make it the default?<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @lincoln @jlstephen so you haven't seen failures with the host that moved over fully to the RPM installed CA certs?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:00)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> we're testing moving everything today to RPM-based install just to see if the issue resolves itself<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:08)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> we're in a downtime today for a dcache update anyhow<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:21)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> if it does we can swing back around on this and scratch our heads some more :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Probably an item more for the HTCondor team, but the facilitation team is suggesting using late materialization (max_idle=) and that still seems to be undocumented in 8.9 documentation<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:20)</span> <b>zmiller:</b></span> @rynge We have our weekly devel meeting this afternoon, I can raise the doc issue.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:55)</span> <b>zmiller:</b></span> We discussed Documentation for Late Materialization, moved it up in priority... should be some progress on it next week.<br/>

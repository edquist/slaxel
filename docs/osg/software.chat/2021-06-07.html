<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(08:49:06)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> I specifically added <tt>/.singularity.d/libs</tt> to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for pyglidein.  this was important, as by default it ignores the host env<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hmm, I'm looking at the image, and it seems to set it correctly. Are you seeing this somewhere else?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:13:00)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> maybe to help explain, I'll draw a diagram:<br/>host slot -&gt; OSG glidein -&gt; singularity -&gt; pyglidein -&gt; user job<br/>so, it was getting set right by the OSG glidein and appearing correctly in singularity, but pyglidein was removing it before.  I "fixed" that part<br/>

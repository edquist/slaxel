<h3>Tue Feb 23, 2021 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:05)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Do I really have to pay some $ to view old Slack conversations?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:34)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> OSG would need to pay<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:40)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Unless they're archiving it somewhere<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:39)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I am trying to read <a href="https://opensciencegrid.slack.com/archives/CJ161RXEE/p1611600127004400">https://opensciencegrid.slack.com/archives/CJ161RXEE/p1611600127004400</a> but I can see only Jan. 29 or later and Slack is asking me to upgrade<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:00)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> That's a big problem w/slack, unfortunately.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:48)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> OK, So I really have to upgrade to read it.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:39)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I don't think you can individually, I think the entire org has to be upgraded<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:48)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> @blin will know more<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we'd have to pay<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-02-24 09:50:18)</span> <b>burt:</b></span> One workaround for this: the admin of the workspace can export the entire history for any public channels - without paying.  You could then import it into mattermost.  (I’ve done this for another slack and fired up a mattermost container).<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there are education discounts and whatnot but we haven't pursued any of them<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:54)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I think Brian B looked into it and OSG isn't technically education according to their rules<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:06)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> IT's probably at least worth setting up a slack archival bot<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> our philosophy so far has been that if you need something from chat, that's something you probably should save in a ticket or some other form<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> in a way not having org-wide archival has encouraged us to turn things into docs or work items, which are better tracked in version control or a project management system<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:45:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @matyas I'm going to test my map changes on topology-itb<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:46:41)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> go for it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Anyone a "OSG-WLCG topology/service interface expert"?  Horst has an XRootD origin registered, but it's not a stashcache origin.  It's an SE.  Does the WLCG care about the service type?  I don't see any XRootD services registered for the ATLAS MWT2 or UNL.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:01)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> "care" in what sense?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:28)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> For example, for downtimes, does the WLCG look at the specific service type, or just that it's an SE?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:10)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The downtime: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/3b73f54a6ef4a0a037a5970505eb06f032ab608e/topology/University%20of%20Oklahoma/OU%20ATLAS/OU_OSCER_ATLAS_downtime.yaml#L424">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/3b73f54a6ef4a0a037a5970505eb06f03[…]versity%20of%20Oklahoma/OU%20ATLAS/OU_OSCER_ATLAS_downtime.yaml</a><br/>The resource is OU_OSCER_ATLAS_SE (probably registered in the WLCG?).  The services "down" are "GridFtp" and "XRootD origin server".<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:11)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> My issue is that this is the only "XRootD origin server" that is not a StashCache Origin server.  OU is using this as an XRootD door to their SE.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:48)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> so the question is, what is the WLCG actually looking at?  Does the services matter, or just the resource name?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think it depends a bit on if you're talking about something like AGIS or CRIC<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> because CRIC will only note the downtimes if the service corresponds to a registered protocol in CRIC<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:52)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> We defined this for CIT and CMS told us for an entry to appear in downtime, these are what they support (I guess it comes from WLCG?):<br/><pre>'XROOTD', 'XRootD',<br/>'XRootD.Redirector', 'XRootD origin server', and<br/>'XRootD component'.</pre><br/>

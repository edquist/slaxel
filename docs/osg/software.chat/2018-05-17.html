<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:05)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @andrew.melo Would the <tt>MaxIdleJobs</tt> knob be of any help? (Probably only useful if B is consistently full)<br/>Also, if you're using SLURM, submit the jobs with a list of partitions rather than having multiple routes?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:54)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I have maxidlejobs as a pinch measure, but as you pointed out, it only works one direction. The example I gave is simplified, and it's not just a change in partition I'm trying to do unfortunately :disappointed:<br/>

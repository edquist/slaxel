<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:48)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> @bbockelm So, this whole Globus Gridftp Server Managed endpoint stuff, am I right in that is incompatible with how we transfer data in CMS/OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:19)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> @tmartin yes<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:40)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> You need endpoints at both ends for a Globus transfer<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:18)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Right, so the gridftp servers that  we use cannot or can act as one of these managed endpoints?<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:20)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> You _can_ but not for much longer <br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:52)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> They will have to be Globus Connect 5 servers starting January<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:33)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> To do a Globus transfer <br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:52)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Right, I figured that, I can probably get the data transferred by then, I was just not sure if we could ever use them at all<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:58)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> You can you have to jump through some hoops though<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:13)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> Esp with the authentication<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:42)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Ya, that is what it looks like,<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:48)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> The whole Myproxy business<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:02)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> Yeap<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:30)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> I gave up trying to get cert authentication on a Globus Server  that was OAuth running <br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:35)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Ya, every time I looked at this I basically threw up my hands too<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:10)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> I know cert authentication works at nersc <br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:15)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> Question is for how long<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:21)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> It seems like this setup for this globus stuff is pretty crazy. It might be just because I have been doing this the OSG way for so long I am having a hard time translating. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:42)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> hey - sorry, was having lunch<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> there's some under-the-table tricks to make them work together, but I think they'll get broken in the next year or so.<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:14)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> That is what I figured, I kept running up against how they want to authenticate<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:13)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> yeah - you can log in to their CLI via <tt>gsissh</tt> and then delegate your "normal" X509 proxy to one endpoint.<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:30)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> You can do it through their SDK as well with delegate proxy<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> but yeah - for a few months maybe.<br/>

<h3>Wed May 12, 2021 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:01)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> @dwd: I have vault 1.7.1 and htgettoken 1.2. and htvault-config 1.0 queued up for release tomorrow. I see there is a newer htvault-config working through development. Is the current set to be release workable?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:02)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> It is workable, yes, it’s just that htvault-config 1.1 has a few bug fixes so it would be nice to get it included.   Nobody but me is using it yet so it really doesn’t need much testing before release.  I expect there will be more users soon so I’d rather they have the latest one.  Thanks for the notice because I still need to update the htvault-config for documentation 1.0+ because configuration has changed significantly.   <b>@edquist</b> can you do the <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4567">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4567</a> VMU tests?<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:01)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> Hi Dave, sure i'll kick off tests<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:35)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> If you are OK with minimal testing. I can release 1.1 tomorrow.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> also fine by me<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:47)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Sounds good<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> there is not a block to release xrootd v4.9.1 for sure ... However, I have few issues installing <tt>xcache</tt> package from scratch, though ... update on existing installations where xrootd is previously installed looks just fine, there is a conflict fetching xrootd on CC7 host at CERN which I turned into OSG34 host (still figuring out if this is the case if I do same on CentOS host in UNL openstack) ... also, another thing, that's for @matyas maybe, I found there is <tt>xcache-1.0.3-1.osg34.el7</tt> in <tt>osg-testing</tt> as oppose what is refered in the tickets which say <tt>xcache-1.0.2-1.osg34.el7</tt> and links to v1.0.2 build... should it be v1.0.3 in the build table in the tickets?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah it should be 1.0.3<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:43:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sounds good, would you mind edit/update it in the tickets, please?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:26)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> sure<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:37)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> interestingly I have a problem load koji pages, surely using proper cert ... doesn't work from Mozilla nor Chrome:<br/><pre><br/>An error occurred during a connection to <a href="http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu">koji.chtc.wisc.edu</a>. SSL peer rejected your certificate as expired. Error code: SSL_ERROR_EXPIRED_CERT_ALERT <br/></pre><br/>any idea?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> crap, looks like I mistakenly have loaded expired cert, sorry for the noise...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:18:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> for the the <tt>xcache</tt> package it seems like scratch install on new host has some issues ... moving on the thread with @matyas to talk about it...<br/>

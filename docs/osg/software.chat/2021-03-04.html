<h3>Thu Mar 4, 2021 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:02)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Didn't realize that #software was where this discussion had landed.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:33)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Since I was the one who brought it up<br/>• I hate email lists for community discussion<br/>• I see any forum as public documentation and question answering<br/>• It's not for chat and wouldn't replace things like Slack.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:54)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> I have seen enough questions asked on the <a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">discourse.mc-stan.org/</a> about unpublished work. Yes its public so people have to be careful.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:21)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I think they can be useful as long as there are moderators/facilitators who can help drive the discussion. I've also seen a lot of forums that are ghost towns and only tumbleweeds post there :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:41)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> An example from the <a href="http://ask.CI">ask.CI</a> page, which might be the one @cat was referring to.<br/><a href="https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/t/how-do-you-add-your-institutional-hpc-cluster-to-the-open-science-grid-osg/75">https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/t/how-do-you-add-your-institutional-hpc-cluster-to-the-open-science-grid-osg/75</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:29)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Absolutely @lincoln. Letting a forum be the wild west is not a good thing.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:23)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> "Who is going to be responsible for our corner of web" is a tricky question given everyone is busy and stretched to the limit.<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> glideinwms is voodoo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:53)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> condor-8.8.x will never be in the osg 3.4 repos right? moving from 8.6.x --&gt; 8.8.x will happen with the osg 3.5 release? And if so, any idea when that will be? A USCMS Tier2 site is wanting condor-8.8.x but doesn’t want to use upcoming repos (silly … upcoming is _so_ the new stable!)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we're expecting osg 3.5 in july/august<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and yeah...upcoming is literally the new stable lol<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:42)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> the default security settings changed between 8.6 and 8.8 so an upgrade _may_ break without manual config changes, which is why 8.8 is in upcoming<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:53)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> :thumbsup: thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:20)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Followup question from the same site — is OSG 3.5 likely to also include HDFS 3.0? I’ve been a bit out of the loop on the saga of trying to (re)build the cloudera packaging if it’s even possible.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that's looking unlikely for 3.5.0 because of cloudera licensing changes for HDFS 3.0 that aren't open-source friendly<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hey - did the user and host notifications go out yesterday?  Anyone know?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:58)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I got one for a hostcert for a host that's decommissioned and won't be renewed <br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:29)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Good, I think?<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:12)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> No, I didn't get to it with all the releases yesterday. But, they went out today.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:22)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> The release announcements didn't go out, yet. Rob Quick said he would take care of it.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:43)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> Is there are better way to get the release announcements out?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:51)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I think that's something we need to ask him to document... not entirely sure which email lists it goes out on.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:41)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> oh hey, it all went out.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:22)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> Yup, we need to be able to do that directly now.<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:31:14)</span> <b>hufnagel:</b></span> Does OSG distribute an xrootd client in cvmfs? Looking at CMS stageout fallback options if the system doesn't have one installed (but cvmfs is available). We currently use a 5 year old version from the CMS cvmfs repo as a fallback, but this is now too much out of date (actually observed some failures recently), looking for a replacement option.<br/>

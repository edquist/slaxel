<h3>Fri Feb 15, 2019 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @blin next IRIS-HEP topical meeting looks interesting. It's at 10:30 Monday; should we postpone the tech meeting?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh i was thinking it didn't look super interesting<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but if people want to attend, that's fine<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:09)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> feels like a 50/50 chance to me mostly depending on what they mean by "modules"<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I could go and then leave early for the meeting if it turns out not to be interesting<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> as a side note, cmssw looks interesting from a packaging standpoint<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> they have a single git repo with all their packages but then do sparse checkouts for manipulating individual packages<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> and a bunch of git helpers to manage all of that: <a href="https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-git-tools">https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-git-tools</a><br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:13)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> FWIW, a lot of that is an artifact of how CMSSW was developed with CVS<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> right - they essentially implemented "the github workflow" on top of CVS...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:52)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (although probably the one-mega-repo model is correct, given the synchronized release schedule and propensity to have cross-module pull requests)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:49)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> That was a fun ... "discussion"<br/>

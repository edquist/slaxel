<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin - SciTokens' API is a real PITA to use because it only exposes C functions, not C++.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> the upside of exposing C functions though is that ABI compatibility is leaps-and-bounds better.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> good to know<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:05)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> As someone who has spent an absolutely inordinate amount of time trying to get around the c++11 STL ABI incompatibility, I'd prefer that people did C first and then C++ 2nd :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:08)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> As someone who likes languages like Go where C++ bindings are hard to do, I also like exposed C functions<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:24)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> On a more general/philosophical note, the niche for C that I don't see going away for at least like 20 more years is a lowest-common-denominator language for writing libraries that can be used by everything else<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:12)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> In my case, it's even worse, I can't even link a C++ libraries together because XRootD only accepts std::string for paths, and while C7 patches g++ to *only* use the old STL ABI, the LCG/CMS/etc... compilers don't :confused:<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:41)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> Rust?!?!?!<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Dunno if rust really helps here :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:54)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Esp. since they (at least in the past, I don't follow them too much) explicitly said the external ABI was _not_ stable. (I don't know if the APIs are stable, but unless everything you're connecting is in rust, you have to fix an ABI)<br/>

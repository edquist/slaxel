<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @andrew.melo at least it's somewhat consistent again. that broke my brain a bit yesterday<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is the old CE getting pilots?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:45)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Some showed up and were running. I saw edita's email but haven't had a chance to dig in (CERN meetings now)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @andrew.melo so the blahp appears to still do some work on the proxy even if we disable proxy renewal in the config<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the permission denied is super weird though, would it be possible to watch the dir containing the proxy to track the ownership of the proxy?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:50)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I finally wrapped up my AM meetings and have the afternoon to myself<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> also, <tt>GRIDMANAGER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG</tt> will blow up the gridmanager config but tell us what proxy path that the gridmanager is passing along for a given job<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:43)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Yeah, let me try and first double-check that CE1 came up correctly. I didn't see any obvious errors last night, but maybe a component of condor didn't come up ok<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <tt>condor_ce_config_val -dump</tt> and blah.configs from the old vs new CEs could be helpful, too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:31:03)</span> <b>eric.appelt:</b></span> I'm looking at the config val dumps, is there anything specific I should be checking for in the diff?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:51)</span> <b>eric.appelt:</b></span> The old ce is HTCondorCEVersion 3.4.0 and the new one is 4.2.1 so there are a number of differences<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> could you just attach them to the ggus ticket? i'd like to have them on hand while code diving<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oof<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:56)</span> <b>eric.appelt:</b></span> sure<br/>

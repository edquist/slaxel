<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:21)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @matyas @blin I am having a problem with downloading a file from <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu">http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu</a>.  It always starts downloading but stops at around the same point, at 158,985 bytes according to wget.  It only happens on my htgettoken tarballs; I can download other, larger tarballs and rpms with no problem.  It doesn’t seem to matter where I copy the file.  I have two different versions of the file, they both get stuck.  URLs are <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream/htgettoken/1.0/htgettoken-downloads-1.0.tar.gz">http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream/htgettoken/1.0/htgettoken-downloads-1.0.tar.gz</a> and <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream/htgettoken/1.1/htgettoken-downloads-1.1.tar.gz">http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/upstream/htgettoken/1.1/htgettoken-downloads-1.1.tar.gz</a><br/>

<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:49)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Interesting.  I have also now updated the 1.1 file where I rearranged the order of the files in it and that doesn’t get stuck.  I don’t think I get a choice of what URL type to use; the download using http is built into osg-build<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:54)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> any objections to me removing all the versioned release tags for 3.2 today? example: "osg-3.2-el5-release-3.2.0"<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (from koji)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:37)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> you can't do downloads from those tags anyway so they're only useful for convenient history (which build was in which release), which we already have as text files<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> let's do itttt<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @dbox you'll want to look into github pages: <a href="https://help.github.com/en/categories/github-pages-basics">https://help.github.com/en/categories/github-pages-basics</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you can have your CI push documents to a separate branch and have the pages build off that branch<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:35)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> this has a bunch of stuff I was missing, thanks<br/>

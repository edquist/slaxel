<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:27)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> "“In 3.4.0, we will also be dropping HDFS 2.x with the intention of adding HDFS 3.x in a subsequent OSG 3.4 release when it becomes available upstream.” —— that line is going to generate a lot of questions.”<br/><br/>Is that implying the 3.4.x repos won’t have any HDFS packages to start? Thus sites using HDFS will need to either not move to 3.4.x or provide their own packages?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> exactly<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:37)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah - we shouldn't use "dropping".  Did the message already go out?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:53)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> "The OSG 3.4.x series will support HDFS 3.x.  To avoid compatibility issues - and since OSG 3.4.0 will be released before HDFS 3.x - the first few releases in the 3.4 series will not contain any HDFS packages.  HDFS sites are advised to utilize the OSG 3.3 worker node until HDFS 3.x is released.  OSG will make sure there is sufficient time for HDFS sites to transition from 3.3 to 3.4 once HDFS 3.x is released."<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yes it did<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> -.-<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we can send a reply and expand on it if we think it's necessary<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I sent one to the CMS internal list. Should be sufficient.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>

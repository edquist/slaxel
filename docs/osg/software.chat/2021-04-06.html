<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:52)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Hi Folks, what are the plans for el8 and timelines from your end? Mainly for condor/xrootd+all plugins/lcmaps? I see lcmaps is available already. (Would be great also if possible to build globus-gridftp for el8 - as experiments are not ready to move out from gridftp - I think timeline is way longer as we want to move forward)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:35)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Can't give you a full timeline but you can expect condor-ce and condor for el8 (for 3.5 at least) this month.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:50)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> as a result we should be able to get xrootd/xcache in as well<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> gridftp, though...installing gridftp on el8 strikes me as an interesting choice<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:46)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> my main reason for this movement is - ceph and all the new features which depend on newer release (centos8 )  and are not available under centos7. as we have mix of WN and data -<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm i see<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:12)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> have separate gridftp on el7 for cms, mh… not an easy task<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> are you using centos 8 stream or centos 8 proper?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:40)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> proper one<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:58)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> I should try stream someday<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:07)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> but if cms or osg say stream is way to go - we will look stream :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok, we'll keep gridftp in mind<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> gridftp shouldn't be difficult to build -- it's available in EPEL 8 so we just need to make sure our patches keep working<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:52)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> cool :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:45)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Nebraska’s CMS cluster is slowly gaining CentOS 8 Stream hosts as well (primarily for CEPH as well) … and our main HPC resource is going to CentOS 8 right now even, so all effort to build EL8 things is of course appreciated :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:43)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> what about xrootd/gridtp? or you mount via centos7 (I guess is doable)?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:50)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> and or condor wns?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:21)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Mounted via centos7 on those for now (they already run 5.x kernels) — workers are likely going to just run modern kernels as well. Some already do and have for ages, so it’s a minimal change to our “mode of operation” so to speak.<br/>

<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:47)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> do you guys currently announce container releases? if not, would it make sense to start? :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:10)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> q I got today was asking how to know when a new HostedCE container image is released<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:47)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I think SLATE could do that.. but for images we don't directly build it requires us to scrounge around on the docker hub org<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we do sorta, we mention containers that got tagged as stable since the last release in the release announcements<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not sure what sort of notifications wouldn't make people mad, though, if we're doing this on a regular basis<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what were you thinking of doing on the SLATE side for that?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:55)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> yeah, I was just saying the same thing, it's a bit of a tightrope walk<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:04)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I don't want to flood anyone with verbosity .<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:32)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> on the SLATE side we might just post a "Latest container images" table in the portal that you can view the build date for<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:48)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> because tags have no real meaning<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:54)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> foobar:latest could be built 3 years ago.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:51)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> but I pretty much made that up on the spot so uh, don't take that as the best possible way to do things :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hahaha<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the best thing i could think of is something like an RSS feed that had details on relevant diffs with each newly tagged container<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> or maybe instead of diffs, a list of relevant packages + their versions<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> though i'm not sure how to include changes to the Dockerfiles and that sort of thing<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:32:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> maybe just the commit they were built from?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that could hide a bunch of changes but maybe that's ok<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we should probably still announce major changes for some definition of major<br/>

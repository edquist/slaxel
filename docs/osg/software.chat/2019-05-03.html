<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:44)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> there's a chance that packaging it ourselves for el7 should not be as much of a beast as it used to be... the Fedora folks spent a lot of time building RPM macros for making maven builds easier<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> <a href="https://fedora-java.github.io/howto/latest/#mvn_macros">https://fedora-java.github.io/howto/latest/#mvn_macros</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:40)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> caveat: pretty sure those aren't available for el6<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:18)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> we might just have to put our foot down and say 'if you want hadoop 3, you'll need el7'<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> or 8 (jeez redhat what's taking you so long)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, i think we'll be going into hadoop 3 with only el7+ support in mind<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> completely separate topic: i want to disable i386 builds on koji, which will speed up build repo regeneration. this won't affect osg folks; @jthiltges, @dweitzel, do you have any i386 rpms in your repos?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:16)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @matyas I sure hope not!<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:56)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I took a look at things. Nothing at Nebraska should need i386. If it does, we deserve whatever breaks.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Thanks! I like your attitude :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

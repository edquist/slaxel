<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:04)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hi @zalak - what's the latest news on the test bundle?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> @andrew.melo uploaded a file: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.slack.com/files/UA01XMFP1/FAJBA7C68/oim.pdf">@blin Not sure if you still need this, but..</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> cool, that's helpful<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:21)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'm not sure if it's really useful to have per-resource granularity instead of just saying "the whole site is down", but that's how it's implemented<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> eh, i could see it potentially being useful<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if a site has a CE, xrootd, and gridftp but only need to do work on xrootd, it can still reasonably accept jobs that just need gridftp<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:24)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> AFAICT, the only thing it's actually used for is to calculate site readiness. The factories still (try to) send pilots, etc..<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> wait, even if the CE is marked for downtime?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:32)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> People still attempt to connect to gridftp, etc..<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> It's just a management tool to distinguish between scheduled maintenance and "oopsies"<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:10)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Just FYI in case anyone hasnâ€™t seen it, but the github also apparently also did the same thing that twitter did and had logs with user passwords in cleartext form<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:50)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> ugh thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh yea, thanks for the reminder<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:41)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> they say that affected users were emailed but changing your pw might be prudent just in case<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> i didn't see an email<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:28)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> Only affected users got the email<br/>

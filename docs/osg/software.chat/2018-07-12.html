<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:39)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> looking at the repository now.  Is there a requirement to keep old resources in the repo anymore?  Historically, OIM had no way to delete resources.  I think they had some idea of keeping archaeology in OIM.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:26)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> messes up gracc accounting if they go away, but gracc accounting is only kept for 1 year<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> so we're planning on deleting them once they've been gone for a year<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:47)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Messes up GRACC re-summarization.  We only do that going back a year.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> GRACC has tons of data over a year old :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:17)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> So, as long as the resource doesn't have any GRACC records in the last year, it can be deleted.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:24)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> so… next year, I can ask for deletions?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <tt>git history</tt> helps here if we want to do archaeology.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Carl's writing a thing that checks GRACC records to see if something's gone<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and we're already getting rid of inactive/disabled resources (with the caveat of not removing resources with accounting records in the past year)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> here's a tentative list (<a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/pull/103">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/pull/103</a>)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:35)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> whoa whoa whoa.  Clean up lots of data?  Is that allowed in the OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:45)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> ok, good… you have everything that I was going to ask to be deleted in that list<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:38:30)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> any idea when that PR will be reviewed and merged?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:39:21)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> reviewing it now. I dunno if we want to remove perfSONAR/Squid/other resources that don't report to GRACC in the first place. opinions?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if they're inactive/disabled, i don't see why not<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if anything, not reporting to gracc removes our 1 year restriction :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:47)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> For perfSONAR ones - maybe query Shawn McKee?<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @bbockelm: @efajardo and I took the conversation to slack and we were just going to drop the monitoring lines. But if you want to keep them:<br/>1. What do we tell sites to set <tt>all.sitename</tt> to? The topology resource name, topology site name, or something else altogether?<br/>2. What are the OSG monitoring hosts?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> anybody know anything about <tt>xrootd-fuse</tt>? we don't test it in the nightlies because it's "incompatible with GSI" -- is that still true?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:27)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> which monitoring lines?  We for sure want monitoring.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin - <tt>all.sitename</tt> defaults to the topology resource name.  However, add a note/warning that CMS has separate instructions for its sites.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @dweitzel is working on automatically transforming the data prior to sending it to WLCG.<br/>

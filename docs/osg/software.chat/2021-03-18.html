<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:07)</span> <b>tanaka:</b></span> Hi I am trying to install <tt>minihtcondor</tt> in an Ubuntu 18.04 docker image following the steps outlined here <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/instructions/ubuntu/18/stable/">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/instructions/ubuntu/18/stable/</a> but run into this error <tt>System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.</tt> during the install. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hi @tanaka I think @matyas can help point you to a minicondor image that's currently under development that you may be able to use instead<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:50)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> in general, though, you have to run docker containers with some extra flags to get systemd running in them and sometimes they do nasty things to the host!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> This is a known issue because Ubuntu tries to enable the condor service when installing minicondor and of course it doesn't work in a container.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:37)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> one sec<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:56)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> for now you have to apt install htcondor then copy the minicondor config file into /etc/condor/config.d: <a href="https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/blob/master/build/docker/services/mini/00-minicondor-ubuntu">https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/blob/master/build/docker/services/mini/00-minicondor-ubuntu</a><br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:58)</span> <b>tanaka:</b></span> @blin ok thanks. And I see.<br/>@matyas okay. I have this working nicely in a centos container, which has been great. but someone that I work with wanted Ubuntu so ..<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:18:10)</span> <b>tanaka:</b></span> @matyas thanks! I will give this a try<br/>

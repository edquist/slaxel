<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:19)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> Hi, I am trying to update our site config in the OSG topology (Purdue University).  After I made the changes and the push request, I get back an error.  I removed an old (before my time) resource in our yaml file in addition to adding a new resource that we are bringing up.  The error I got returned to me indicated the failure was when it tried to validate the downtime yaml file.  Do I need to also go remove old downtime entries for the retired resource there? Or should I just put the retired resource back in our site config?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @smithnp, i was just looking at this!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:01:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it looks like the resource is safe to retire so you can just remove all of the corresponding downtime entries<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:01:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (or i can handle that if you'd prefer)<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:02:21)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> I still have the repo up and can take care of it.  I just wanted a bit of verification before I did much more as I still feel a little "in the weeds" when it comes to some of our OSG stuff :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah for sure, thanks for asking!<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:09)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> I submitted the pull and just got approved for the downtime.yaml, will I need to do anything to get the previous site config request to push through again?<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:38)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> ah, I see the email confirming that now :slightly_smiling_face: thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> just merged the initial PR, you're all set :smile:<br/>

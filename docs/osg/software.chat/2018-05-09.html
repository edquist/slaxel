<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:38)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> One silly Singularity question, if I may: we're getting successful pilots and jobs now for the Fermilab VO, but one of our glidein startup scripts that checks the OS still advertises it as SL7. The script itself is just parsing /etc/redhat-release. Now if you do the same thing from within a payload job that's running Singularity, you do indeed see something that looks like SL6. It's just a bit odd that the glidein startup script behaves in that way. Glideins at Nebraska, however, do advertise SL6, though it's certainly possible that something is configured differently there as opposed to OSC, where we are testing things now. I'd like to get to the bottom of it though because otherwise people who request an SL6 slot won't be able to use these OSC slots (to get it to work now I just didn't set a preferred OS). Any ideas on why we're seeing an SL7 redhat-release at glidein startup? Maybe it's a sequencing issue (i.e. the script runs before Singularity actually starts)?<br/>

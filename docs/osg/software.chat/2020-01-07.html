<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:05)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> @blin I have this error: HoldReason = "Error receiving files from schedd <a href="http://osg.rc.ufl.edu">osg.rc.ufl.edu</a>: DCSchedd::receiveJobSandbox:7003:File transfer failed for target job 2243.0: SCHEDD at 128.227.221.228 failed to send file(s) to &lt;188.184.104.127:46593&gt;: error reading from /var/lib/condor-ce/osg/spool/2243/0/cluster2243.proc0.subproc0/_condor_stdout: (errno 2) No such file or directory; C_GAHP_WORKER_THREAD failed to receive file(s) from &lt;128.227.221.228:9619&gt;"<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:20)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Do you have any suggestion to debug this?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> did that job otherwise complete successfully?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <tt>condor_ce_history -l 2243.0</tt> on <a href="http://osg.rc.ufl.edu">osg.rc.ufl.edu</a> may be helpful<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:13)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Thanks. I was told it might be due to the switch. I will check that and come back if the switch did not fix the issue.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @blin @matyas: I'm stumped, it seems user still has an issue with fork-ing topology repo: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/4bd6ee29d3810a31eaf39b07ff4428cc904a528b4112422b2fd723e7862e7841">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/4bd6ee29d3810a31eaf39b07ff4428cc904a528b4112422b2fd723e7862e7841</a><br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think we need more info on exactly what he's doing<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> he already has the repo forked here: <a href="https://github.com/deesto/topology">https://github.com/deesto/topology</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but it looks archived somehow<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but is he actually clicking the fork button here? <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/sPHENIX.yaml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/sPHENIX.yaml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> or is he clicking the edit button (i.e. the pencil icon)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(22:06:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, I believe he knows what he is doing ... he described it in the ticket and the procedure seems correct to me ... don't you want to comment in the ticket and ask him? or, I can...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(22:14:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I replied to him and suggested remove that repo from his project space and do a fresh fork ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-01-08 10:31:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> mystery solved, thanks!<br/>

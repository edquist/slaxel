<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Is there a way to always use the "latest" yum osg repo? For example, looks like we have version numbers in places like the yum repos file<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:48)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> mirrorlist=<a href="http://repo.grid.iu.edu/mirror/osg/3.3/el6/release/$basearch">http://repo.grid.iu.edu/mirror/osg/3.3/el6/release/$basearch</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:23)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Nope - that's on purpose.  The release boundaries are defined by when we do something sufficiently disruptive that you need to manually examine the config.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> If you could safely auto-update, it wouldn't be a new release series.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:25)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Is there a place where I can get the yum repo files for sl7 without installing the rpms?  E.g. a url I can wget them from?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:08)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> You can always wget the RPM and then manually unpack the files<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:56)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I was hoping to avoid that, just being lazy but I guess Iâ€™ll just do that<br/>

<h3>Tue May 14, 2019 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jthiltges @ivukotic @horstseverini we just promoted xrootd 4.10.0 RC1 to osg-testing so if you guys are interested in taking it for a spin, it should be available in the yum repositories shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jteheran @dwd do you have a tester for osg-pki-tools at the ready? (cc @tim.theisen)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:12)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Fermilab people aren’t very motivated because nothing changes for them.  Ideally David Sanders would test it, the person who wanted the new option.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:43)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I sent a message to him that was available but didn’t explicitly ask him to test and send results.  I could do that.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if you could, that'd be great<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:58)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Ok done<br/>

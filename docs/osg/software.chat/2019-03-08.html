<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:20)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> from #osg-support: I'm getting GridFTP into a Centos image on Docker and can docker commit it to a new image later if an official Docker GridFTP image is a desirable product<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:12)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> several images for GridFTP appear in the Docker repository so perhaps the OSG image is called for. I don't know how licensing and stuff works, really, just trying to be helpful<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if it's something using the OSG packaging, I think we'd be interested in it<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> got a link to your repo?<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:37)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> Not yet, but I'll let you know when it's working. The problem I'm encountering is that the Centos Docker image may not have enough resources to run GridFTP in anonymous mode, although it appears several other groups have done this successfully<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:05)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> What do you mean, specifically, by <tt>OSG packaging</tt>, @blin?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> where are you getting the gridftp package from? does it have an <tt>osg34.el7</tt> suffix or anything like that?<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:39)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> <tt>yum install osg-gridftp</tt>, <tt>Package osg-gridftp-3.4-7.osg34.el7.x86_64 </tt><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, that's the OSG packaging :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:07)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> sweet, let's see if I can make it go<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> got a user doing a 3.3-&gt;3.4 upgrade that's having trouble because yum update is trying to install "python-condor-8.6.11-1.el6.x86_64" from epel. his priorities are fine. i _swear_ we've run into this before; anybody know how we fixed it?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:28:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> why doesn't our condor-python package Provide python-condor?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> probably because it's the old packaging<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think @tim.theisen's python-condor change to satisfy EPEL python reqs was fairly recent<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> more recent than our latest 8.6 build<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> why doesn't this show up in our nightlies?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:19)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> that's question #2<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @matyas, any objections to my vo-client testing?<br/><a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3652">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3652</a><br/><a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3658">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3658</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> nope. lgtm.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:37)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> challenge question (I didn't find google answer): "What's difference between AssertPathExists and ConditionPathExists and when to use one or the other" ... that's for systemd unit files<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> more precisely, didn't find answer which would satisfy me<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Condition... means "silently skip it" and Assert... means "fail it"<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:48)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> it will affect what you see in the logs and in systemctl status<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well I tested it, I don't see difference, it doesn't start service in either case<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:57)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> systemctl status says either "condition failed" or "assertion failed"<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and ... Condition/Assert was not met ... hence service didnt' start<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>

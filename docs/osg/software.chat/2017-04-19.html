<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Are the OSG twiki pages finally gone? Anyone have a link to the new ones on GitHub (i think)?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:10)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Nevermind, I think I never loaded my renewed cert into my browser .... oops. Old cert expired on 9th.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <b>@edquist</b> - did the GUMS template update tickets @blin filed in JIRA make sense to you?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, new JIRA seems doing bad things ... having more JIRA tickets opened it kills my firefox ... consumes quite lot of mem when having more tabs open with JIRA especially ... never had this before and used to have sometimes more tabs open with JIRA<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> my cpu fan finally stopped spinning that loud ... another jira tab killed<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> how many jira tabs?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @schmiecs have you seen any performance issues with JIRA?<br/>

<h3>Thu Mar 29, 2018 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:50)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> I have a curiosity question.  What is OSG’s view of RSV?  Is it supported?  Is it on the list of software that is or will soon be deprecated?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:06)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> (I suppose that is more than “a” question…)<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:51)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> On the way out, if I remember Brian's talk.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:16)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Actually not specifically mentioned.<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:35)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> 99% sure it’s on the way out. Tim (I think) was even digging down and finding the last few remaining sites that have been reporting RSV things to let them know as such.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:16)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> OK.  Thanks<br/>

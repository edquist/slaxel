<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:56)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> Hey @bbockelm, whenever you've got time I'd love to hear about your ES stuff and, more specifically, how you pull the data from classads into logstash.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:22)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I free up around 3:00 - chat on the phone then?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:51)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Particularly, I don’t use logstash.  I push them directly to ES.  Here’s my not-meant-for-public-viewing scripts: <a href="https://github.com/bbockelm/cms-htcondor-es">https://github.com/bbockelm/cms-htcondor-es</a><br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:15)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> That sounds good to me (I have a coworker, CJ, working with elasticsearch stuff and he'd like to also sit in if that's alright.) I mentioned this to Todd Tannenbaum and he seemed to think you were doing an OSG call at 3?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:20)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> And thanks for the link!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:20)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hm.  Suppose that’s a good time to hijack the OSG call then?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:50)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> Yeah, I can ask to sit in if no one has any objections<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:10)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I don’t object.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:44)</span> <b>eringrasmick:</b></span> I guess it'll just be us and Zach so that would be perfect, we can plan on that then<br/>

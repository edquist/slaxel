<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:28)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @blin @marian: When configuring an HTCondor-CE job route, do we have to do anything special to capture the submit attributes from the factories? e.g., if I set nothing in the job route, will HTCondor-CE pick up +xcount=8 from a multicore glidein submitted to it?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, it will<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:22)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, but probably still a good idea to configure some defaults at Job Router anyway?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:29)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> if it's in the ROUTE as well it's just something that double protect things go to particular ROUTE unless you really want ot<br/>

<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:44)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yep, that what I would recommend, especially in more complicated queue setup and different HW used in the cluster etc<br/>

<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:08:43)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Out of curiosity: Has anyone tried installing Rocky Linux to kick the tires a bit?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> We've got a couple dev boxes running 8.3 for messing around<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:53:02)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> couple things got tripped on /etc/release having something unexpected, but they were fixed pretty quickly<br/>
<span style="color: #619a4f"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:55)</span> <b>sull0153148:</b></span> We need to rebuild an OSG cluster at the University of Minnesota and have tried the Treydock OSG module and manual configuration. We keep running into dead ends. We need help. Has anybody used the treydock puppet module successfully? It seems to miss a lot of important things.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm, Trey runs an OSG site still but i'm not sure if he maintains his puppet config<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> folks certainly use puppet extensively in the OSG but OSG itself doesn't provide puppet configs: we can certainly help with any manual config questions, though<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what's the latest dead end that you've run into?<br/>
<span style="color: #619a4f"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:12)</span> <b>sull0153148:</b></span> What's more common, slurm or condor?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:05)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> IMO stick to Condor unless you have a demonstrated need for Slurm specifically<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:33)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> you'll find more Condor experts to help with config in the OSG community<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> OTOH, Slurm's a close second<br/>
<span style="color: #619a4f"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:28)</span> <b>sull0153148:</b></span> Our first question is which OSG version and REPO is best to use. 3.5 or 3.5 upcoming?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:06)</span> <b>hahnx117:</b></span> (I'm also at Minnesota) we ask because this doc suggests to use 3.5 upcoming, which I've been doing<br/><a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/install-htcondor-ce/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/install-htcondor-ce/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> for a compute entrypoint, 3.5 upcoming is the new recommendation<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:49)</span> <b>hahnx117:</b></span> I think what might be tripping me up is the subcluster setup. <tt>condor_q</tt> on a worker node doesn't see the ce<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah sure: <tt>condor_q</tt> will give you the jobs submitted to a specific schedd and is generally run directly on the schedd host<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you have other schedd's other than the CE?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (<tt>condor_q</tt> from a WN probably isn't a use case that you need to support, tbh)<br/>

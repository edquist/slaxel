<h3>Mon May 6, 2019 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:06:07)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @matyas@bbockelm I messed up on the promotion of singularity-3.1.1 in EPEL and ended up resetting the release clock for another 2 weeks. So it will have to wait until then.  @blin, how soon will osg 3.5 be coming out?  Should we wait for singularity-3 to become current until then, or get it into an osg 3.4 release along with EPEL?  Or should we maybe remove it from osg 3.5 and just go with EPEL?  I wouldn’t want to remove the osg documentation page, and it would be a bit strange for osg to document something installed from EPEL.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:07:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> iirc, there aren't any disruptive changes between singularity 2 and 3 so I'd be on board with moving 3 from upcoming to release<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:08:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think for 3.5 we can start with just using what's straight out of epel (and keeping our documentation, i think that's fine)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:08:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we'll always have the option of shipping it ourselves later<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:31)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Yes I think singularity-3 is compatible enough with singularity-2 for it to not cause disruptions.  It’s still going to be a while until osg 3.5?   The one concern I have with the upgrade is that there are more significant changes than usual to singularity.conf, and I’d hate for people to ignore the .rpmnew file and keep using a singularity-2 conf file for singularity-3.  It should work though.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:16:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if that's the case, we should probably wait until 3.5<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:17:00)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I just checked and the differences are comments, the default for underlay, and 3 extra default options.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:02)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Some of the comments are for other new options, with no default given.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:07)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> How long until 3.5?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> my guess is not until the end of the summer<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we haven't had major kickers for it<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if singularity 3 can function with the singularity 2 config then that's more reasonable<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and that doesn't sound like a lot of config changes<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:21:08)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I just tested and at least the basic functionality does work.  Also we do remind people in the singularity install instructions to watch for .rpmnew files and merge in changes after each upgrade, but I don’t know how many people actually do it.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:21:30)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> We could explicitly remind again in this release announcement<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:22:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we often do that<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:22)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I’ll make a ticket then.  Maybe we can time it to come out not long after EPEL in 2 weeks.  When we moving something from osg-upcoming to osg, do we delete all the old versions from osg-upcoming?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, they get removed<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:07)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(09:26:59)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> btw singularity-3.2 is expected any day now so maybe that’s the one we’ll end up with in 2 weeks.  EPEL’s probably won’t be updated by then though<br/>

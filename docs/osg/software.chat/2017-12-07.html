<h3>Thu Dec 7, 2017 : #software (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:22:28)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hey, software folks - there seems to be a high-quality phishing attack going out to at least some OSG folks this morning by email.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:04)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Subject line is “notice of data breach”, and it looks quite convincing. The GOC is aware of it, says it is bogus, and is investigating actively.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:15)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ugh, I *just* saw that it is a security exercise.<br/>

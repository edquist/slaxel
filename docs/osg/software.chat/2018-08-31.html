<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:39)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin <b>@edquist</b> - any updates on looking at the xrootd-lcmaps policy plugin bug?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i was just about to set up a pow wow with <b>@edquist</b> to discuss it<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and other prios<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:09)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> There's another important fix from John Thiltges.  Should the release wait up for the policy bugfix?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:34)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Could you also bug the xrootd dev list about their release plans<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:42)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face: I'm tired of the being the only one asking...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> lol, could you get me the contact info for the list?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ah, you aren't on it already?  I thought you were.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> er, i don't think so<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:16:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> unless it's a very quiet list<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:16:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i just get what you/marian forward me, i think<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:22:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I can write directly to Andy and Michal cc you if you want, @blin? I think they were more responsive there as oppose to writing to xroot-dev ... what issues we're particulary interested get fixed in the release candidate?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian yeah, let's do that for now. i'm not sure if there were specific fixes/features that @bbockelm was looking for in 4.8.next<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but maybe he's also wondering about the timeline for 4.9?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> email sent, @blin<br/>

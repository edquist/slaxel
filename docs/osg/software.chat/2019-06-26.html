<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:47)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> yes they need to talk to the CMS redirector<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:56)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> if they want to use the /user space<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok, makes sense -- who do they talk to in CMS so that their endpoint can auth to the redirector?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:09)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> There's some AAA operators mailing list, but @marian also does some of this, I believe.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:17)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> what is actual question? they are CMS and want to subscribe to AAA Federation? Or something else, @blin?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, Brown ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> right?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> let me check<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:10)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ugh, that ticket bit diverged from original question I suppose? First it looks like they have CMS user that wants to access files in AAA via crab, that is answered by Edgar it needs to contact computing-tools hypernews and get familiar with things ... then it seems like Jeff is saying (paraphrased by me) Brown wants to host some specific data set of that user and have it available in the AAA. Moreover then it looks like he tries to setup yet another xrootd server? totally confusing ...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that sounds right to me? why would it be unreasonable for them to install an xrootd server?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Brown is CMS T3 and they had several unsuccessful attempt to subscribe their storage AAA, as I recall most of reasons were infrastructure changes, different admins talking to us, host replacements here and there, misconfigurations etc ... do we have someone at Brown friendly who can speak to us what is problem? I know about several GGUS tickets which went to "closed" without resolution.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> they have/had servers already<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and existing/working setup afaik<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> if they want to add yet another server that's fine<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:58)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I think part of it is that they got rid of their sl6 cluster and moved to sl7 (which meant dropping the old stuff), butt that happened at the same time as an admin change as well<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, I'd agree with Andrew that adds up to confusion<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and bigger issue to troubleshoot<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> They've got a really big campus resource and their campus offered "unlimited" storage to them to store CMS data, so it'd be good to get things sorted. I think part of the problem is there's nobody really invested on the CMS side in fixing it for them except their PI<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'd setup email thread with t3 site support representative and somebody who is currently assigned to CMS at Brown to get them back on track of the things<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:16:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> CMS T3 support representative would be @clundstedt who is just few doors next to me, I'll talk to him about the situation<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> unless anybody else has better idea ... but the ticket mentioned for Brown (<a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/f426e050715054b2cfe1ab1b9a0284931c6c9c270ef536be61c4dba2defc2630">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/f426e050715054b2cfe1ab1b9a0284931c6c9c270ef536be61c4dba2defc2630</a>) is intermix of things atm<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that sounds good to me, as the admin and I are a bit lost on the CMS specifics<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:58:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> do we still need the CA files named after the openssl 0.98 hashes?<br/>

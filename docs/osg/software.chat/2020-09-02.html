<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:16)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> What an incredibly strange failure mode<br/>

<blockquote>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-09-03 10:23:13)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Our CEs don't mount the shared /home, so the pilot users didn't have home dirs. There's apparently a hidden directory used by blah that points symlinks to the pilots proxies. Since the home dirs don't exist, the creation of those symlinks fails, but that doesn't cause an error on submission. Every 8 hours, blah goes through the motions of renewing the proxies, even though we have that turned off on the CE. It can't find the proxy and barfs at that point<br/>

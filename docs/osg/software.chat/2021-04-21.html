<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @matyas our htcondor-ce central collector tests are failing on EL8 because of issues finding the <tt>mod_auth_openidc</tt> package. from some googling, i thought that it would be available through <tt>AppStream</tt> but it doesn't seem to be in that repo<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> then i came across this, which works <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CentOS/comments/g2b1e3/centos8_mod_auth_openidc/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CentOS/comments/g2b1e3/centos8_mod_auth_openidc/</a><br/><pre>dnf module enable mod_auth_openidc</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i thought we were free of modules for a few EL releases :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:16:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> why is there a separate module specifically for mod_auth_oidc??<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:17:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> redhat gonna redhat?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> &gt;  i thought we were free of modules for a few EL releasesÂ :disappointed:<br/>"We have changed the agreement, pray we don't change it further"<br/>

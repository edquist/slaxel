<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:37)</span> <b>xizhouf:</b></span> Is the osg repo server down? I got a time out error when installing cvmfs on a work node.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yes it is, we're hoping to send an outage announcement shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:53)</span> <b>xizhouf:</b></span> Thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:46)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Koji's also down.<br/>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:02)</span> <b>duncan.macleod:</b></span> @blin, is there any idea when <a href="http://repo.opensciencegrid.org">repo.opensciencegrid.org</a> will be back?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm i don't have very many updates. I did hear that the k8s master is back up but i still can't query for services<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> quick update: the power outage was not kind to us and we've had some db corruption<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:54:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we're hoping to have the underlying infrastructure up and running tonight and crossing our fingers that means the services will come up along with it<br/>

<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:31)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> @bbockelm I am being asked to grab a more recent xrootd-hdfs from Koji at Wisc. I notice there is no RHEL7 version, I am told that does not matter, but I was just curious if such a thing is being built? Seems odd to see only RHEL6. Wait...I see I can search for that version...sigh...<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:02)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @tmartin the RHEL7 version ought to be there<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> perhaps you're seeing outdated mirrors?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:01)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> wait, you're trying to get it from koji. um, <tt>yum clean all --enablerepo=*</tt> ?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> the version for el7 is the same as the version for el6<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> 1.9.2-2<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:48)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Probably, I just did not see it on my first pass<br/>

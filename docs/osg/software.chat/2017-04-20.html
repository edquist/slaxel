<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> five-six and it starts to be an issue<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> or, after ticket update it gets content of ticket gray and freeze until I hit refresh button in the browser<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I can reproduce it also on my home computer ... happens on firefox and chrome<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so it's not just at work where I have in the browser  &gt;20 tabs open<br/>

<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:10)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Did the admin list get blown away when changing from the FNAL server to the IU server?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:50)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Or maybe when it looked like my funding was going away<br/>

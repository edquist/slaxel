<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:26)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> <b>@here</b>, is there any way to get an email read receipt for emails sent via osg-notify?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> currently, no<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not sure about the feasibility either. are read receipts something that we can throw in the header?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> email wizards, @tim.theisen or <b>@edquist</b> may know something about this?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:44)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> email read receipt? that thing that I always turn off in my client?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Most email clients do not send back read receipts.  Most email senders (mailchimp...) use invisible images that are loaded on reading the email.  But that only works for a small portion of email clients.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:48)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Ok. Yeah and we send plaintext emails via osg-notify so, embedding an invisible image is not an option.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:59)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Thank you all.<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:11)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> You could update osg-notify to send an html email but even then (as derek says) it works by loading an image via a link, that is, not an inline image in the email, and for images like that there's not guarantee that the email client will actually load the image - more often the client will warn the user and ask if the user actually wants to load the image<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:07)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> at that point you might as well put a link in the email that says, "Click me to acknowledge your receipt of this email; Please and thank you."<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:37)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> &gt; at that point you might as well put a link in the email that says, "Click me to acknowledge your receipt of this email; Please and thank you."<br/>but then people will think it's a security exercise<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:55)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:10)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> yes,<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:13)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> the conclusion is<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:36)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> if an "email read receipt" works, the recipient has failed a security test<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe that was the security exercise all along<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and everyone passed but me<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:15)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> lol<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(20:42:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I would be fairly resistant to put invisible tracking images into a security-related email I send...<br/>

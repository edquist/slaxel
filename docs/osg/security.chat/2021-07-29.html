<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:00)</span> <b>daues:</b></span> Would this be a channel for discussing responses from xrootd, particularly sysXrdHttp,  and its security impacts?<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:20)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> Hi Greg, we usually use this channel to discuss security announcements and vulnerabilities.  The folks with the most knowledge of xrootd are probably going to be in the #software channel.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @daues more specifically #xcache has a lot of xrootd experts<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:00)</span> <b>daues:</b></span> ok Iâ€™ll try there!<br/>

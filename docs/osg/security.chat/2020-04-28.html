<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @drakejc i found this in some email archaeology<br/>&gt; OSG has been able to test the combination of the 1.103 bundle (so with the new root for InCommon) with the addition of the AddTrust root CA and it fixed the reported issue (rhel6 client with new bundle talking to server with old bundle and InCommon host cert). <br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so i think we can build a cert bundle without the expired CA and see if that plays nice with CERN clients<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but we'll also want the CERN clients to remove the CA and make sure that works with both the new and old bundles<br/>

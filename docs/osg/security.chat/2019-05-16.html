<h3>Thu May 16, 2019 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak @stanfiem would one of you be able to get around to putting the latest security announcement up? <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/security/OSGSecurityAnnouncements/">https://opensciencegrid.org/security/OSGSecurityAnnouncements/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we've got a release going out today that addresses the issue and it'd be really nice if we could just reference your announcement in our announcement<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:53)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> yeah I will take care of it as soon as I figure out mkdocs...something is wrong and the announcement md file isn't getting linked correctly into the overview summary.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:55:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if you have a branch on github or a PR open, I can take a quick look<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:01)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> that would have been the smart way to do it<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:28)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> i was lazy and just directly committing what seemed like 3 straightforward edits....<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:22)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> nvm maybe I'm just impatient<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:23)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/security/vulns/OSG-SEC-2019-05-14-Vulnerability-in-Singularity/">https://opensciencegrid.org/security/vulns/OSG-SEC-2019-05-14-Vulnerability-in-Singularity/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:56)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> sometimes it takes an annoyingly long time to update the html pages<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:08)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> yeah that seems to have been the case<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:02)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> caching ftw!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> nah, it's not the browser cache<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:39)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> no - it's the CloudFlare cache.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:46)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> can we do something about that?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> or it's not our cloudflare but github's cloudflare?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> It's our CloudFlare -- you can always log in to the management console and hit the cache flush.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> but there's no 'reduce cache lifetime for these sites' setting?<br/>

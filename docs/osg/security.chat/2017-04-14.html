<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:07)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @zalak FYI, I just went through your PRs in github...they all failed tests, but it seems to be due not to your work but an error in the TravisCI setup.  I'm debugging, but expect it to take a while to get a response as I'll probably have to re-run some of these more than once.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:49)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Alright, thank you for the update.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:41)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> I found the breakage in the TravisCI script and emailed Brian...getting it fixed will require help from someone on his team, because I don't have access.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:05)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Oh Okay. Thanks.<br/>

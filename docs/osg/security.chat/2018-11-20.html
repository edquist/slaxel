<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey <b>@here</b> if i rename a file + its gpg detached sig, i don't have to worry about resigning the file, right?<br/>

<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:35)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I believe that’s correct, that gpg does not encode a file’s name into a signature.  Test it though.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, it looked fine on my own tests but i wanted to make sure i wasn't doing anything stupid<br/>

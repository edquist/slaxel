<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @dwd @matyas @tim.theisen - I just saw on the Singularity public release that a high-severity vulnerability has been posted (and a corresponding 2.6.1 release is available).<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:10)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Yes, I have notified <a href="mailto:security@opensciencegrid.org">security@opensciencegrid.org</a> and am building for EPEL<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:16)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Does not affect singularity-runtime<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> sounds great, thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Since it doesn't effect singularity-runtime do we not care as much?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:10)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> A little less importance, perhaps.  Still should be treated very urgently.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:10)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Yes<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:18)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @blin @bbockelm I was wrong, it does also affect singularity-runtime because the instance.start command is there.  It also affects the instance:// URLs to regular action commands.  @blin please act on SOFTWARE-3510<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:50)</span> <b>rlkiser:</b></span> Starting to draft an announcement. Do we have any more details than are available on that page?<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:11)</span> <b>rlkiser:</b></span> @dwd Any additional details on the mitigations being discussed in the email threads? If setting mount points to private will significantly break things for people that changes the alternative mitigation strategy.<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:22)</span> <b>rlkiser:</b></span> Also, I would hope that setuid isn’t available by default, but I don’t know.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:24)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I am composing an email to your question.   Setuid is available by default.  It was not a viable option to disable it until RHEL 7.6, which was just released, and it has not yet been fully tested.<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:39)</span> <b>rlkiser:</b></span> Ok, thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:32)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Please let me comment on the draft once the first version is made.  I have been the primary author on all the previous singularity-related announcements from the OSG security team<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:43)</span> <b>rlkiser:</b></span> Ok. I sent you a link in a direct message.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:57)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @rlkiser Where did you get the information that it required only systemd-based system with shared mount propagation?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:29)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I think that’s probably right but I want to verify it<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:19)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Oh, that’s right in the announcement from singularity<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:42)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I read right over that at first<br/>

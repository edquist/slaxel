<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:44)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> @matyas no I haven't gotten back around to it...I had issues logging into moria with the temp password that was provided<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:11)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> I was going to reply to that email to have the password reset, unless there is someone else I need to ask.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:55)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> try replying to that email first<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:35)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> ok I'll do that<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:55)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> fell off my radar with all of the other things going on lately, but with the end of the month coming up I'm glad you reminded me.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @stanfiem remind me what login name you got on moria; might as well add you to the right ACLs while I'm thinking about it<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:36)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> @matyas stanfiem<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> oh and send me an email with the password hash you generate from <tt>htpasswd -n stanfiem</tt> (S/MIME or GPG encrypted)<br/>

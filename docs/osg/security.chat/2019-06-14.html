<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:10)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> No. Do you want me to share it with them?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:01)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Brian's out today so I guess this can wait until Monday<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:56)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @zalak, <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/10160">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/10160</a> and <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/10161">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/10161</a> got routed to software for some reason but they should have been routed to security instead so I reassigned them to you<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> shouldn't be a big deal - just people responding to the Ebury Malware announcement<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:26)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Thank you Mat. Just checked those tickets.<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:20:01)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Hi, @mvkrenz :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(08:20:23)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> good morning<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:20:59)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> How's life?  I just saw you online and realized we hadn't talked in a while.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(08:21:41)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> all good.  you?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:24:18)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Pretty good.  Wishing I could gently excise Apache Struts from all of OSG, but I don't think that will be possible any time soon. :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:46)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> well as far as I know we don't have it operations :slightly_smiling_face: one less thing to worry about<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:36:41)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> I *think* it's only in voms-admin.  I sent out an email to find out for certain.  It's my impression that Rob hates that insecure ball of Java as much as I do, so I will be unsurprised if ops has none of it. :smile:<br/>

<h3>Thu Jul 8, 2021 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:34)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> @blin do you know who owns the OSG Slack space? we don't have anyone on the security team who can invite or admin this channel<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i've got admin + a few others<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> idk if you can give unpriv members admin over specific channels<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> any existing member should be able to invite others, though<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:28)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> how aggressively is membership pruned?  there are a lot of names with membership in this channel we don't recognize<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> never<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It's a public channel also.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> If you want you can start a separate, private channel like #security-team or something<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:54)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> those don't show up in the channel list; you have to be explicitly invited by a member<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:28)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> if its a public channel that is fine, I just want to make sure we don't have information sitting in here that is at all sensitive.   The security team already has secure internal comms, so I think we just need to set a welcome message that clarifies this channel is only for TLP White announcements and communications.<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:15)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> set the channel topic: Welcome to OSG's PUBLIC security channel.  This space is for TLP WHITE questions and communications only.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> can you add a link to what TLP WHITE is?<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:12)</span> <b>drakejc:</b></span> set the channel topic: Welcome to OSG's public security channel.  This space is for TLP WHITE questions and communications only (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/tlp">https://www.cisa.gov/tlp</a>)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:22)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> thanks<br/>

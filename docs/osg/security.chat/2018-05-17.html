<h3>Thu May 17, 2018 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:23)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Are we supposed to send a similar announcement for a vulnerability concerning NetworkManager integration script included in the <br/>DHCP client packages in RedHat Enterprise Linux and derivatives (<a href="https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2018-1111">https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2018-1111</a>)?<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:28)</span> <b>jteheran:</b></span> I have not had the chance to read the CVE nor the advisory; is it applicable to us?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:12)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Summary: A command injection flaw was found in a script included in the DHCP client (dhclient) packages <br/>in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network <br/>able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges <br/>on systems using NetworkManager with DHCP enabled. [R 1] <br/><br/>Seems like irrelevant.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:42)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> But, then I'm wondering why did the EGI send an announcement for this!<br/>

<h3>Thu Jun 20, 2019 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @stanfiem have you had the chance to look at my email/comments for the container security policy<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak where do we stand on getting all of our security announcements published?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> a local admin pointed out an announcement from december that i can't find<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:56)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> I believe all the announcement are already there except the most recent one (Ebury Malware).<br/><br/>Also, I double checked our Google drive, we didn't send any announcement in December.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah i see what it is<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <tt>Subject: OSG-SEC-2018-12-12 URGENT FOLLOW-UP Critical vulnerability in Singularity</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm, but the two "critical vulnerability in singularity" announcements aren't the same here <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/security/OSGSecurityAnnouncements/">https://opensciencegrid.org/security/OSGSecurityAnnouncements/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (i included security@osg in my response to our admin, which has the announcement text)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so it seems like we're missing some announcements<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:51)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> I still couldn't find that one in our usual Google drive repository for announcements. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1e5efShgft5_htK708D6EntbnlZ0ulAzZ">https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1e5efShgft5_htK708D6EntbnlZ0ulAzZ</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> sure but you saw the email from me responding to our admin, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> they've got the body of the announcement in the email<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:56)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Ah! got it. I was on vacation in December. So, whoever created that announcement didn't put it in our usual folder.<br/><br/>I will check your email after my meetings. I will be in meetings until 4 pm.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> also, i'm not sure what the protocol is but if the security announcement from december is no longer valid (due to updated software), do we send another security announcement?<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(13:30:05)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Yes, so if the patches for the vulnerability became available, we send a follow-up announcement.<br/>

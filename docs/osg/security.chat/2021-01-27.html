<h3>Wed Jan 27, 2021 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:57)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Hi folks, don't know if you saw <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66660">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66660</a>. It's a question about the security announcement.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that looks like the right EL7 version to me<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> also, there might be something weird going on with osg-notify -- it correctly set the From name to "OSG Security Team" but the From address is <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a> (which is why this user's response created a ticket)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:24:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (and also why Thunderbird is complaining about a PGP key mismatch)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:10)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> argh that's because we haven't packaged a new version yet<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we did fix that though <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4349">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-4349</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:35)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> thanks for the heads up, I don't seem to get any notification when there is a ticket for us.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:55)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> and grr typos....the dangers of reviewing before coffee<br/>

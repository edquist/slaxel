<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:18)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @mvkrenz So now that we have our new spiffy SSO up, how does one actually switch from using certificate auth to SSO for things like tickets?  Is there a doc somewhere?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:12)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> Susan, we have not rolled into production yesterday. A couple of users have reported some issues. So I am troubleshooting on whether it is client setting specific or needs any code modification.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:42)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> The switch should not effect anything. you should be able to login as you were able to do right now. Current login information will be synced/verified with the information CILogon provides upon login.   I can put together documentation.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:35)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @mvkrenz Thanks, and apologies for getting the deployment date wrong.  I appreciate the info. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:52)</span> <b>mvkrenz:</b></span> We wanted to roll it out yesterday but it became necessary to troubleshoot  a little bit more to rule out remaining kinks<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:46)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Gotcha.  Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:22)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Hi, just wondering how contact changes will be handled as a result of this exercise.<br/>For example, Horst said to remove Joel Snow if he's still a contact (which he is, at many places). Will you make PRs and/or tickets? Will you ask the current contact to make PRs and/or tickets? Should Software do something?<br/>

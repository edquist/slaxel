<h3>Tue Apr 21, 2020 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey security folks, i've got a question about where you would prefer some documentation for our SVN infrastructure: <a href="https://github.com/matyasselmeci/technology/commit/8a6f84a31876a14ef135f3ff12b5054abedb551d">https://github.com/matyasselmeci/technology/commit/8a6f84a31876a14ef135f3ff12b5054abedb551d</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is it sensitive enough that we should put it into a private google drive or is the info ok to put in a page on <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/">https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/</a>?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> we moved most of the internal infrastructure docs to the infrastructure google drive<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:39)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> sensitive or not IMO we should put it there to keep things in one place<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:51)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> merge it with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FTp5wa-5Lcfgt0hMWf_FvmqbqRckfW6qfORmpFU-dao/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FTp5wa-5Lcfgt0hMWf_FvmqbqRckfW6qfORmpFU-dao/edit</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that sounds good but i'm curious what the line is between "should be private" vs "is ok in public docs" for this type of stuff<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah good question<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:23)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> it is a good question, Jeff and I were just talking about it the other day<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:55)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> before I had this job my stance was usually "should be private unless there is a compelling reason to make it public"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:35)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> I don't see anything in that documentation that is scary, but I will note that the CHTC wiki link that apparently contains details about how to do some of this is in fact password protected :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:22)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> @blin, could you please share that ticket info here?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the one that was opened 2 months ago?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it was just a minor bug in osg-pki-tools<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> resulting jira ticket: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3591">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/SOFTWARE-3591</a><br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:43)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Thank you.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak there actually were two other tickets that i grabbed. One was Horst asking about the AFS security announcement a couple of months ago and then there's another user asking about user certificates recognized by IGTF<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we should talk about the latter today at the sec weekly<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'd add it myself but i didn't see the agenda up<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:28)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> I will add it to the agenda later this afternoon.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:21)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hi all - I've got a problem with the concept of a team in OSG that isn't reachable via <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>.  It's obviously fine to have a security-specific "entry point", but the above conversation makes it sound like if someone has a security question and happens to write help@osg, then we tell them they have gone through the wrong door.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak ^^ let's talk about this during the meeting, too<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:54)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Ok.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:54:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we should also talk about a new ticket creation form<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @stanfiem @rlkiser i just added you two as "occasional" freshdesk agents<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> this means that whenever you log in to freshdesk, you use up a day pass<br/>

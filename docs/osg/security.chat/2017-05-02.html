<h3>Tue May 2, 2017 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:45)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @dwd @zalak @apadmana ... can one of you cover this afternoon's production meeting for Jeny?  She had a conflict.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:19:00)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> IIRC, she's sending the report to Tim ahead of time and can copy you so you know what's going on.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:24)</span> <b>apadmana:</b></span> Sorry just saw this, what time is the meeting?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:57)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Jeny just let me know that she can cover it after all (her conflict was rescheduled) so never mind.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:02)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Sorry for not updating here.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:07)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Thanks, though.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:23)</span> <b>apadmana:</b></span> Good to know! Thanks<br/>

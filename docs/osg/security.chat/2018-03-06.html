<h3>Tue Mar 6, 2018 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:36)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @bbockelm: Trustico did it because they were trying to revoke thousands of live, in-use certificates and screw over their users, they weren't allowed to do so, so they purposely compromised those certificates' private keys (which they should not have had in the first place) because compromise is a legit reason to revoke without the owner's permission.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:50)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah - I still hold that it was tough to figure things out from the article though ;)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:27)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> I will take your word for it.  I'll admit to not reading much of the article; I got to watch the thing happen.  (crypto engineer boyfriend had met up with me and we were gawking at the SSL list drama as he's actually on that list)<br/>

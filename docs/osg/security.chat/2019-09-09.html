<h3>Mon Sep 9, 2019 : #security (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:34)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> How can I tell if a cilogon identity provider is using the OpenID CA or whatever the other one is? Is there a list I can get?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:53)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Specifically, is ORCID good for getting certs that are usable in OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak @stanfiem ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I emailed them; they said ORCID is also OpenID<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:58)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Google accounts are granted CILogon-OpenID certificates instead of CILogon-Basic. But, I'm not sure how can you tell.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> they didn't tell me how I could know ahead of time (although I could look at the issuer once I already had the cert). But they gave me the explicit list of OpenID providers: Google, GitHub, and ORCID; all others are CILogon Basic or Silver<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:37)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> I will add your question of whether or not ORCID is good for getting certs that are usable in OSG in our weekly meeting agenda.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:53:17)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I mean, they told me it's not<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:53:21)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> &gt;&gt;&gt; Currently, CILogon supports 3 OpenID CA Identity Providers:<br/>Google, GitHub, and ORCID.<br/><br/>Logging in with any other IdP results in issuance of Basic CA (or<br/>potentially Silver CA).<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think zalak is saying he'll bring up openid certs for a discussion on suitability by the security team<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:34)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> oh ok<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:18)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Is CILogon OpenID in the osg-ca-certs bundle?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> no but we ship it in 3.4 and 3.5 release repos in a separate package<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:06)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Correct. I will discuss the suitability of CILogon-OpenID certificates in OSG with others in the next meeting.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> particularly for the OASIS service, we whitelist specific DNs, if that helps<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Same for auth access to the topology webapp (although the only thing that does is let you see users' contact info)<br/>

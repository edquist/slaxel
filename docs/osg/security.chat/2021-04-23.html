<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @stanfiem we're starting to see IGTF certs issued where their full chain ends with the <tt>subject=C = GB, ST = Greater Manchester, L = Salford, O = Comodo CA Limited, CN = AAA Certificate Services</tt> CA<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (so it goes IGTF CA -&gt; COMDOO RSA -&gt; AAA)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:53:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't recall seeing the AAA CA before and there doesn't seem to be much info about it on the COMODO side<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:55)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> hmm<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:11)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> sectigo likes to do weird stuff so i can't say i'm surprised<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:57)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> but that is a root CA that's been around for awhile...not sure why they would switch it. i can poke around and see if anyone else knows anything about it<br/>

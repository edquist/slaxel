<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:07)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> @blin yeah that is my concern as well, but given that we are sending plain text emails anyway I think it might actually make them look better? It's not a lot of markdown.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:12)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> but we'll see how it looks.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> good, i just wanted to make sure you guys were keeping it in mind<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey <b>@here</b> are you guys going to make that CA cert JIRA ticket? i didn't see one come across my inbox<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:14)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> That's my job<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i told security that they could make it since we got a release last week and they hadn't seen a jira ticket created for them yet<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:01)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> The release announcement was yesterday morning. I already created the ticket. I can close it, if you like.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah sorry, i must've misremembered what was said during the security meeting then<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> let's just use yours<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> for the future though, is there any reason why the security team couldn't just make the jira ticket themselves?<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:27)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> They have been less reliable in the past. I remember having to poke them. They can make the ticket. Although, they should add me as watcher. Last time they made the ticket. I didn't get any notice that it was ready for testing. Although, it would be nice it I would be notified if any SOFTWARE ticket is marked RFT.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't really care who makes the ticket, as long as there's only one made<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it makes sense for whoever notices the release first creates it<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:37)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> Fine with me<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak @stanfiem @rlkiser @jteheran @sesons i've got a few PRs waiting on someone in security to review <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/security/pulls">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/security/pulls</a><br/>

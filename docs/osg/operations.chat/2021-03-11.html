<h3>Thu Mar 11, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:27)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> in the squid section of toplogy what are the differences between "monitored: false" and "monitored: true" ?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:21)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> one of our new slate squids apparently appears in the monitoring but has no data, and i just now saw that it's set to monitored: false in Topology. would setting that to true maybe start gathering data?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:13:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, it should<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:13:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> see #3 here <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/frontier-squid/#registering-frontier-squid">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/frontier-squid/#registering-frontier-squid</a><br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:15)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> groovy<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:23)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> Regarding Fresh Desk triage and the document regarding it -&gt; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUZ-LRVoCGj9arMwPMq8SbqbIUOJnmDqTHCo4pMWKlM/edit#heading=h.7ee2lzo6su6i">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUZ-LRVoCGj9arMwPMq8SbqbIUOJnmDqTHCo4pMWKlM/edit#heading=h.7ee2lzo6su6i</a><br/>The document refers to <tt>operations</tt>.  There is an <tt>operations</tt> group and an <tt>operations</tt> type in our Freshdesk.  Which are we ("we" being ops triage) concerned with?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:27)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> I notice that if I filter on <tt>operations</tt> group, I often see tickets whose agents aren't necessarily in ops, like Brian Lin (at list I think you're not in ops Brian?)<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:33)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> I definitely think that <tt>operations</tt> should not be both a group and a category<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i do have the pleasure of being in the Ops FD group<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and yeah, the duplication of type/group for Ops and Software is a little silly because a type is required for each ticket iirc<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> at least for the Software team we haven't had the need to provide more detailed metadata in the Type field<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:56)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> What is the relationship between "Ops", "Software" and "Ops FD group"?<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> software = me, mat, carl and we have our own group and type in FD<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Ops FD group should be made up of all members of OSG Ops, more or less<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there may be additional folks in the group for historical reasons but for triage you probably just want to focus on the Ops group -- there should be an existing filter for these tickets already<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:16)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @bbockelm @jdost321 I'll be absent from standup meeting to perform Capital Inventory tasks<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ah, thanks for the heads-up!  Sorry I missed it and bugged you separately<br/>

<h3>Wed May 26, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:23)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> There have been some networking issues at UNL (PKI datacenter, where GRACC lives) this morning — until now these haven’t affected anything beyond hcc-cvmfs2 but a full  reload of the problematic router is required and was just initiated.<br/><br/>This will either be a ~2 minute network outage for all things at that datacenter, or a much longer one and I’ll be changing my address to the Bahamas.<br/>

<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:21)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Full reload done, packets flowing again. This equipment won’t be able to be bypassed until tomorrow (Friday May 27th) at the earliest. We’ll obviously keep an eye on it best we can in the meantime.<br/>

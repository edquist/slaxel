<h3>Tue Apr 23, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> another random thing I don't like on Freshdesk: when ticket is assigned to you, you get an email with just description without notion who assigned nor with relevant info as the description may be already unrelated to the question somebody is asking hence assign you ... would it make more sense if somebody assign you that you receive original description of the ticket plus very last comment? There is probability last comment include it all why it was assigned to you...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> can you either turn that into an email or an operations freshdesk ticket and assign it to me?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sure!<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:05)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I updated it a bit that it's more understandable what I mean ... hope it's clear enough<br/>

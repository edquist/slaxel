<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jpeterson what's Tiger's IP range again?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:40)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> 128.104.100.0/22<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:43:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jpeterson is there an IPv6 range?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jpeterson ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:23)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> we are working on that, should have it in the next few weeks<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> gotcha, thanks<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jthiltges @huijun.zhu do you guys have an IP or IP range for hcc-cvmfs-repo? also, which LIGO LDAP branch do you need with what level of access (read/write/both)?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:39)</span> <b>huijun.zhu:</b></span> The IP address is 129.93.244.215<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:35)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'd be tempted to allow a wider range if the LIGO folks are OK. @gattebury is there a good range for red service stuff?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:38)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Mmm, there’s really two /26 nets (129.93.239.128/26 and 129.93.244.192/26) --- the former is mostly the red service stuff, and the latter mostly HCC and non-Tier2 specific stuff. If they want to open both it would be fine by me, but the latter <tt>129.93.244.192/26</tt> is likely where we’d put/move anything related to this at, so that should be enough.<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:11:36)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> <tt>2600:900:6:1301::/64</tt> should probably get mentioned as well as everything is dual stack there in theory (better to put the decision if it’s relevant or not on them, not us)<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> anyone has a good opinion on this?<br/><pre>James Clark  11:40 AM<br/><br/>Hi @marian,  looks like there's still no singularity @ LIGO-ICTS: HAS_SINGULARITY=false and which singularity  finds nothing in PATH.  What's the best way forward here?<br/>James Clark  11:47 AM<br/><br/>I also see I also see frame reading problems are common at ICTS (not surprising) and at USdC - i'm wondering if HAS_LIGO_FRAMES=True is really accurate or if there's some smart way to better indicate the health of auth cvmfs access?</pre><br/>...this is in regards to FD 67429 (USdC)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that's set by the node validation script. check the pilot logs<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Any chance one of the Jeff’s can jump on this ticket: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67383">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67383</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> WTAMU is contacting me asking what’s going on.<br/><pre>Good afternoon Lauren,<br/>I hope you are doing well.<br/><br/>I am wondering how we are progressing with the OSG setup for WTAMU. It seems that we are stuck somewhere although I am not exactly sure where. If it is something on our end, please let us know.<br/><br/><br/>Looking forward to your advice. Thank you.</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:09)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @jdost321 @jpeterson (not sure who else I should flag). As a reminder, this is a CC* campus, so worth the quicker/more dedicated attention.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:44:19)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I’ll get back to them, I’ve been buried in k8s land for a bit, and they were on the top of my list to check on again after the condor update goes out tomorrow. but I will let them know.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:17)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> done<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Thanks. Can we get them moved up the priority queue? This may be a call for @bbockelm versus whatever k8s stuff is going on, but they’re CC* _and_ have waited quote a bit. And they started asking for the CE more than two months ago.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:18)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> well without the k8s things, the CE won’t work<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:44)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> they are high on my queue already for CE work<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah! Well, maybe explain that the development work is necessary and provide a (very) rough timeline? The radio silence had them worried that no progress was being made.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:23)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I replied to them about that 4 minutes before you put the note on the ticket, mentioning that there is a new release coming out tomorrow and I will be looking at the deployment<br/>

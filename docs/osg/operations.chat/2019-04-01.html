<h3>Mon Apr 1, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(08:24:39)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> @lincoln UMD will likely request a new hosted CE <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/8516">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/8516</a> . BTW, I am still waiting for the University of UTAH and University of Michigan ones. Not that last week I had time to install them, but this looks like a promising one if I get the hardware! Please, let me know.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:33:16)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> hi @marco.mascheroni OK, will get to this today<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:33:24)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> so 3 new ones?<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:48)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> yes, 3 new ones<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:28)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm not making the ops meeting today. One interesting followup on the new flock cert is that we had problems with an rfc version of it with multiple delegations. We switched back to a "traditional" Globus cert and all is good again<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yeah, lots of things don't like RFC, too official! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:28)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, I can't even remember why we were trying RFCs<br/>

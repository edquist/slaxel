<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:08)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm working to resurrect the cronjob to update <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/Software-Redhat">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/Software-Redhat</a> from vdt svn.<br/>I think it'll take a one-time force-push to get things going again, so folks with an existing clone will have some turbulence.<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:43)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm not _entirely_ sure why the history from a new git-svn-mirror doesn't match up. I'm suspecting it's due to the authors-file being changed over time.<br/>

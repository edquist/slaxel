<h3>Thu Aug 12, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:56)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thereâ€™s a ticket about certificate changes in FD - is that operations related?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:00)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> depending on the specifics, it's either ops or software... can you send a link?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i would always send it to ops. if it's a software thing, they'll pass it along to software<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (generally a good rule of thumb, imo)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:20)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay brian, assigned to you but you can triage. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> got it, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'm ops triage, is it ops?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it is, i handed it off to marian since it's a jlab schedd cert DN change<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yup, good triaging<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> which ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:23)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67807">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67807</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, interestingly enough I suggested to change this on scosg16, right ... I can take it from there, but I guess they will be requesting new cert ... can give you the old DN, will update the ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't think we need the old DN? they just have a new DN that we should add to the FE config<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:10)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I also don't know why, just saw in the ticket Derek asked ... thought it's in the Topology and wanted to clean up once JLab swith to the new<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yeah, just nice to be sure to have the old one, even though it's an easy grep.  Makes sure everyone is on the same page.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> good idea<br/>

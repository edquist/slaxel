<h3>Thu Jan 21, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:08)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> One of the River based AMNH CEs started working again this morning (Mendel, looks like the pod was restarted), but the other (HEL) didn’t and restarting it didn’t help, I have now moved it to Tiger and jobs are running.<br/>

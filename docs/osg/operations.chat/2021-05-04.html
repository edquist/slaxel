<h3>Tue May 4, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, we never resolved on the email thread whether UTC’s Epyc cluster is CC*-associated, so I just asked them in the associated ticket. It also looks like we didn’t have a consultation with them? @jdost321 any idea why we might have skipped that step? Is UTC a known entity with OSG history?<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlW019I30hi1ModFsRDvp9ek4wU4vxAmLH-v1pR_MzY/edit#">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlW019I30hi1ModFsRDvp9ek4wU4vxAmLH-v1pR_MzY/edit#</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Is this Chatanooga? I remember having a consult with them<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Oh! Can you find the ticket? I couldn’t …<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrmm i'll try but they were the ones that were halfway to setting up their own HTCondor-CE until we told them that the Hosted CE is free<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah, here’s the thread with the consult: <a href="https://crt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=103093">https://crt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=103093</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> But … now I’ve got the same situation with LeHigh (seeing their CE in the new CE report). They’re CC*, but not tagged as such, and I’m not sure we met with them?<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66990">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66990</a><br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66956">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66956</a><br/>Only other tix I find with ‘lehigh’ search term are contact registrations.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> IIRC, there was a ticket where we suggested a Hosted CE to them and they insisted on doing their own<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we should revive that discussion we were having about this whole onboarding process<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> totally fine if they wanted to do their own! I’ll at least double-check their CC* status for tagging purposes by sending an email via FreshDesk, and offer to meet with them to discuss their interests/plans for OSG participation, if they’re interested.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:48)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Yes, we should revive the discussion about the onboarding process! Maybe you, myself, JeffD, at least, could meet to discuss some issues, plans, and action items? anyone else? ( can loop Mats in after we’ve made some decisions, for example)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i honestly think we can just keep it in campus facilitation for now and consider Ops downstream of the process<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> campus facilitations? campus onboarding? i forget what we're calling it<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Campus Facilitation.<br/><br/>Maybe I’m confused - I’m trying to revive the discussion about ‘this whole onboarding process’ and am thinking we need to incorporate someone from Ops, namely because (1) CEs aren’t getting tagged even when the ticket and/or form notes it, and (2) campuses are coming in via tickets with new CE questions/registrations and not getting routed to Campus Facilitation.<br/>

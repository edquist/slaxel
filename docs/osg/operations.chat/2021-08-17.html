<h3>Tue Aug 17, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:36)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Anything we can do about it?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jpeterson is there a Hosted CE for U Minnesota in the works? I've got a stale campus facilitation ticket in FD and was wondering where that ended up<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:18)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> not that I have heard of?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> mmk, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:20)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> JeffD vaguely recalls waiting on something on facilitation<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marcom @dbox the <tt>JOB_TOKENS</tt> issue seems to be a gwms bug. @jdost321 mentioned that the auto-generated env looks like<br/><pre>environment = JOB_TOKENS='/var/lib/gwms-factory/server-credentials/entry_DUNE_CA_Victoria_dune-condor/tokens.tgz' </pre><br/>and according to the <tt>condor_submit</tt> docs, I don't think you should have the single quotes<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:29)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> Which gwms release is this?  We are trying to get rid of the JOB_TOKENS thing   sooner rather than later, next release candidate I think..<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:20)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> It doesn't break 'normal' CEs that I have tested it on, but its been an annoyance that has been around since 3.7.1<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jdost321 what version is the prod factory on?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:33)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> 3.7.3-1<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:59)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> also, what is this entry submitting to?  Steve Timm noticed some problems submitting to Amazon and Google (and maybe bosco, have to go look) entries that had some misleading JOB_TOKENS error messages that weren't the actual problem.  I think that got fixed in one of the 3.7.x releases,<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:09)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> but if this is 3.7.3 that fix should be there<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:28)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> it's submitting to a weird site that doesn't want to run a CE, direct condor schedd submission<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:55)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> I am resetting my password so I can read the ticket.  It is likely a bug that doesn't affect CEs even though the single quotes shouldnt be there<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> or open an incognito tag and view the full page here: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/2ea0e7c81a3c374627f9b44e79831653eb5c143398ecd4ded19dfd3a8bb94ed8">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/2ea0e7c81a3c374627f9b44e79831653eb5c143398ecd4ded19dfd3a8bb94ed8</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:52)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> ahh thanks<br/>

<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:32)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> right that's what we're thinking. the env var just sticks around all the way to the pilot env var on the WN<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:37)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> a normal CE would have consumed it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:48)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> huh doesn't look like I have permission to look at the ticket.  I can log in, and create tickets but cant look at the link above that ends in 68720.  That just sends me back to the login page<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:18)</span> <b>dbox:</b></span> I guess I don't have to read the ticket to fix the single quote issue but it might be useful<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:09)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> can you log out and look with this? <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/2ea0e7c81a3c374627f9b44e79831653eb5c143398ecd4ded19dfd3a8bb94ed8">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/2ea0e7c81a3c374627f9b44e79831653eb5c143398ecd4ded19dfd3a8bb94ed8</a><br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:27)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> nevermind just saw brian L suggested it in the subthread<br/>

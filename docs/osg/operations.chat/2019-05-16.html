<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(03:51:04)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> I wonder if we should automate (puppetize) things here. Each time I install a CE I go through the hosted CE installation part here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NXb_jQXbbFfwYuaj5MZHB5QqhnWtg7GuZATd6pnShiY/edit#heading=h.llx3xjs8rmhn">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NXb_jQXbbFfwYuaj5MZHB5QqhnWtg7GuZATd6pnShiY/edit#heading=h.llx3xjs8rmhn</a><br/>Should these packages be isntalled by puppet? Maybe suchandra did not wnat to do that because he might have changed some parts of the code though..<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(03:52:35)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> I upgraded the package on ce18<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:31:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we should probably automate a lot of things<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:31:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> packages that we should keep up-to-date: htcondor-ce, gratia-probe*, osg-ca-certs, vo-client<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:44)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Hi Marco, if you have an acct on our gitlab you can make a PR for the HostedCEs although we are trying to put a bunch of effort into containerizing them<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:01:12)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> My goal is to replace all of the existing hosted CEs with containers in kubernetes<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:35)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> Are you working on Igor with the kubernetes stuff? I know he is trying to set up a containerized version if the UMD one<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:59)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> About puppet it's better if you do ity guys, you better know the profiles etc. I asked for the account mostly to check if you did changes when I see a problem with all CEs<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:10)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Ok if you can give us a list of packages that need installed we can do it.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:39)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> We aren't working with Igor directly atm but we just pulled down his CE container and started looking at it.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:10)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> We're trying to set up hosted CEs against test systems at uchicago and uutah<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey jeff, derek and i were talking about tracking internal work for the ops team via JIRA<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it'd be nice to have something other than freshdesk for tracking some of the checkmk work. what do you think?<br/>

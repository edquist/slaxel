<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(09:21:43)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> Hi, did anybody take care of this: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65206">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65206</a> ? It's closed now, but factory-ops was cc-ed and we did not do anything. Seems like @rynge might need to have a look?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it looks like the user closed the ticket ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it's probably worth reaching out to them directly though to see if that was a mistake?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Jessica has another ticket with the user - I will check with her<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:46)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> From the ops meeting discussion: Whole-node jobs should be supported in HTCondor-CE. Added in PR#142, with the attribute name tweaked to <tt>WantWholeNode</tt> in #145.<br/><a href="https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/pull/142">https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/pull/142</a><br/><a href="https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/pull/145">https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/pull/145</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> with no further changes to the CE or local condor, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:00)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I believe that's correct, yes. (Or my git log search has totally failed me.)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:35:33)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @matyas someone doing something on topology. I got an alert that it’s flapping. So up and down a lot. Not necessarily just down. <br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:00)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Carl was updating it a few hours ago<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:20)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> took a couple of attempts apparently<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:24)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:37)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> has the flapping continued?<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:38:45)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> :-xxxxxxxx<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:39:20)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> i ran into more issues than expected doing a topology update<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:39:49)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> (that i somehow did not run into updating topology-itb)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:45:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> looks like my email was delayed a bit.  at ~3pm it was flapping.  at 3:46 it went back to green (good)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:46:09)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I got the flapping alert at ~6<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:46:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> weird .  I blame O365<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:49:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> We need to add you both to the topology alerts. <br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:52:34)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:52:38)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> sorry for the noise<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:53:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> No worries. Your punishment is now you get some of the noise. <br/>

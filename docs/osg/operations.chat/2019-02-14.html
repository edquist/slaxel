<h3>Thu Feb 14, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(07:55:31)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> I just double checked all the hostedCEs, opened tickets to reach the admins when necessary, and updated the OSG Hosted CE deployment information spreadsheed.<br/>In the spreadsheed I am now putting:<br/>1) Status Yes/No and a Keywork that explain the potential error (squid/scratch/ssh etc)<br/>2) In the note I am putting a sentence in red with the last update in case of errors (plus leaving in gray notes about the CE, like customizations in place)<br/>3) In the ticket column I am starting keeping track of all the issues related to the CE. The last one is the active one if the status of the CE is No (freshdesk if I needed to talk to the admin, simple jira if it is our issue).<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(08:00:45)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> UUTAH CEs had an issue like the WSU one: a CE that I thought it was ok while there were validation issues.<br/>

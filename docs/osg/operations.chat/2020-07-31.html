<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(07:55:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> <b>@here</b>: we've hit unfortunate incident with gracc2 frontend ... machine doesn't respond after reboot and we're troubleshooting ... sorry for the unavailability of the gracc service!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> machine is back up and cluster recovering ... we encountered close to 1 hr full outage due this ...<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:56)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> thx marian<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:35)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> apologies for few more hickups over the day with gracc status, almost done with few updates node by node in the config that required restart so health of the cluster went down and up in circles ... assume it fully done and 100% healthy within an hour (one more one needs an config update)<br/>

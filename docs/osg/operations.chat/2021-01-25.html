<h3>Mon Jan 25, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What is the relatively new Georgia Tech site that is contributing (a lot of) resources to the OS Pool since latish December?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:31)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> That is, is it associated with a specific project there? CC*? Etc.? Or did they just fire up and connect a new general-purpose cluster on their own?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:57)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> @cat it is CC*<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:11)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> we (UChicago) have been working with them to get set up<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:48)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> they intend to share the pool with LIGO, VERITAS, IceCube, etc, but we pushed forward with a HostedCE just before the holidays and are backfilling their pool with OSG until their other users ramp up<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:56)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ok, cool, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:05)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> New cluster? Or addition to existing?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:23)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> as I recall, it's a new cluster, with resources from their older cluster folded in.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:55)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I see. Thank you!<br/>

<h3>Fri Apr 23, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin did we decide to (and is it up yet) document the slurm epliogue stuff?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nothing beyond what we already have yet<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i forget where we landed on that one<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> On epilogues, I’m all for it (no reason to keep it a secret), but there was something else you weren’t sure you wanted public?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you remember the ticket was that we were having this discussion?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:03)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I think it was Slack. :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> For now, I’ll just bug @dweitzel again to provide the epilogue info?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm pretty sure we were talking back and forth in notes of some ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Technically, we use lua plugins for slurm. I think they are called “spank” plug-ins. Not the actual epilogue feature. <br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> oh …..<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> changing my email to LSU HSC accordingly before I send<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:31)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin @dweitzel is the stuff linked in the second bullet point (here: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/using-wn/#for-site-administrators">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/using-wn/#for-site-administrators</a>) sufficient to send, and I don’t need to loop Derek in?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Found it in this thread: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66528">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66528</a><br/>also here: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66973">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66973</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah. i think so. if they need help with actually configuring their slurm epilog, then we rope slurm experts in<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but i don't really know how much of it is just those same slurm experts pointing the admin to the slurm docs on prolog/epilog<br/>

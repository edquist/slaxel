<h3>Sun Sep 27, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:49)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> We had a power outage in Lincoln, NE this morning and some network gear went walkabout including the switches the osgmon checkmk instance lives on. Just got networking back moments ago. Just a general FYI in case people get spammed with alerts as the monitoring couldnâ€™t reach much of anything for a while.<br/>

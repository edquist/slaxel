<h3>Tue Dec 10, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The GRACC website is getting an overhaul.  Dashboards deleted... front page reorganized.  If your favorite dashboard was deleted or you need help finding it, we (@marian and I) can help.  We have an internal GRACC which has all of the old dashboards, but you need a GRACC account to access it.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> cool<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> are we going to announce these changes?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> possibly after the changes are completed.<br/>

<h3>Wed Jul 7, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:38:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @jpeterson was there a particular reason that we didn't enable the jlab VO for the ODU CE?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:40)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I’d have to go back and look at the really long ticket.   But guessing it was ‘get it working’ first. And then didn’t circle back to add it if that was the plan<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:49:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ya, i think we should probably enable them<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (please open a new ticket for that instead of lengthening the too long one!)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we can just use the ticket that ODU just sent in<br/>

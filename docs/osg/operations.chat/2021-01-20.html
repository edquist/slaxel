<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:45)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> Are the river issues impacting everything or are there factory issues as well. I have several CEs that stopped running jobs a few days ago? The LE certs look to be valid, and doing an OSG_autoconf on the factory sees them in the settings. (well most of them at least)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:58)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> all of the AMNH clusters for example, (ARES is down because I tried re-deploying on river and it can’t get a new LE cert)  HEL shows LE cert expires Feb17 (jobs seem to have stopped Jan17ish) same for Mendel.  both showing empty queues right now.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> IIRC, we chalked that up to being deprioritized since we were using so much of AMNH over the holidays (@jdost321 would know)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:12)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> there was some of that on their end earlier when I asked them about it, but today they are asking us why it dropped off<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:12)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> speaking of- can you guys give me a summary of any river issues you've seen in the last few days? I am getting other reports and trying to figure out whats the deal<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:18)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I know one thing was that LB IPs are in pending state<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:47)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I think that is what is impacting me (any re-deployed CE) right now.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:28)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> OK<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:07)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @huijun.zhu @dweitzel whats the current link for our check_mk monitoring?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I use <a href="https://hcc-mon2.unl.edu/osgmon/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fosgmon%2Fcheck_mk%2Fdashboard.py">https://hcc-mon2.unl.edu/osgmon/check_mk/index.py?start_url=%2Fosgmon%2Fcheck_mk%2Fdashboard.py</a><br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:49)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> great thanks. i recall the switch to hcc-mon2 just wasn't sure if it was temporary or if thats the new home indefintely<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I think it will switch back to hcc-mon, but I don't have a time line.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:22)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> @lincoln Looks like even CEs we didn’t re-deploy are having issues communicating with the factory<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:19)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I think I successfully migrated WSU to tiger in the meantime<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:53)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Thanks. I have to step out but this is my priority for today/tomorrow<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:25)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> and I have one of the AMNH CE’s over to tiger as well, the one with the expired cert that I tried re-deploying on river first.<br/>

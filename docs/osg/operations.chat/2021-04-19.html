<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:44)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> is the <tt>GF</tt> entry in the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=physics.ucsd.edu_ntbqc79g8mhrilpsh1bfgbtv8o@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago&amp;pli=1">Ops Triage calendar</a> for "GlideFactory"?  Is that the person that should be assigned as Agent to GWMS Freshdesk tickets for the week in question?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yes, I believe so.<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:57)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @jdost321 (or anyone else who would know) I've got a request from Steve Timm to put a CE in front of USCMS TACC-Jetstream and make it accessible via HepCloud factory;  does that belong to Ops?  If so, who should be Agent?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:13)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> (<a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67135">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67135</a>)<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:37)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @moate correct but in practice I'm basically factory ops triager full time until we get more ops effort, thanks for the ticket i'll take a look<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:50)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @jdost321 np;  I owned a couple other tickets that I deemed to be factory ops to Marian.  Perhaps they should be reassigned to you?<br/>• <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67123">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67123</a> "*LIGO sees no SUT-OzStar pilots"*<br/>• <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67137">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67137</a> "*job flow to UConn-HTC is constricted"*<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:21)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I haven't touched base with him to see if he's back yet, what his avilaability is, I'll take a first pass<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:11)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> Should the person on triage duty slide the due date on overdue tickets, or should they leave a note for the agent to do it?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:51)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> i usually ping the owners of the tickets, due dates should be their responsibility, not triager<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:04)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> feel free to bug as much as you deem necessary with your triage hat on :wink:<br/>

<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(02:59:28)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> Yes, the check is run before singularity, it was a wild guess, I thought the two things might have been related.<br/>I think the squid intuition is correct. I see from the environment (here <a href="http://xd-login.opensciencegrid.org/monitoring/glideins/entry_OSG_CA_CancerComputer_kitchener/job.7213332.0.err.txt">http://xd-login.opensciencegrid.org/monitoring/glideins/entry_OSG_CA_CancerComputer_kitchener/job.7213332.0.err.txt</a>) that http_proxy is set.<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(03:03:22)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> AFAIK the pieces software that needs to use the proxy set http_proxy "by hand", I don't think you need to set it. Still, maybe @rynge wants to unset http_proxy in the check_clock script. Or maybe we want to check in another validation script if http_proxy is set, and then fail if it is the case?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Spent the morning debugging APEL numbers.  Turns out, a few sites do not put APELNormalizationFactor in topology for every Resource.  Or, well, it's 0.  APEL script saw the "0", and said, lets change it to a default of "12".  How it figured "12" is a good default, who knows?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:21)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I opened tickets against the top 3 sites doing this.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> should we contact the admins of resources that don't have APELNormalizationFactor set if they're a CMS/ATLAS site?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I have a list.<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:25)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> @rynge is there something going on with the osg flock frontend? I don't see requests anymore<br/>

<h3>Fri Sep 7, 2018 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do we use operations@ or osg-operations@ for the internal mailing list?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I think idea was not using osg-operations@ anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> finding from TimC's reponses, quote:<br/><pre><br/>There is “osg-operations” already, but (a) it has the useless osg- prefix and (b) it has 87 recipients currently and it is completely unclear what the list is meant for.<br/></pre><br/>hence decision use operations@<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:35)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Problem is, all our other lists have a useless osg- prefix<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> are they on opensciencegrid domain too?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> what are they? just curiuos<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:45)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> osg-software, osg-int, osg-sites<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:29)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:41)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> oh, security doesn't have a prefix<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so 2:3<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:20)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> maybe we can delete osg-operations so we don't email it by accident?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> or, can we redirect it to operations@ for a month/two just in case somebody else will write to it?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:40:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> though, decision on using operations@ was on 7/26/18 ... this is a month and a half almost so maybe we can cosider osg-operations@ to retire for good ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and I think that osg-int is more-less replaced by Freshdesk and Slack I'd say ... that can go too imho ... so the remaining ones can become just software@ and sites@ ... solved? :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> :no_mouth:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:54:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ultimately the decision is @jdost321’s since he owns the lis<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it may be useful to have an operations@ and operations-team@? i was thinking about the same for software<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> where the former would be open to people outside of the operations team and the other one would be strictly for internal operations team stuff<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but that may be less necessary than say security vs security-team<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:34)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, who would be operations-team@, really ... currently, all of people from operations@ plus? things were different in GOC times as there were non-OSG-software people, but that changed ... so the lists should, too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (anyway, as you said, @jdost321 decision, just don't put me on more lists, please! :))<br/>

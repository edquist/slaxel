<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:40)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> @rynge What are usually OSG user jobs setting GLIDEIN_Site to? I am always wondering which value I ahve to put in the factory.. More specifically, can you point me to which exact value in topology we need to use (if there is one..)?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I think ResourceName is supposed to be linked to the resource name in topology <br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:20)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Sure I think can be the same as resourcename, but thereâ€™s no rules on it. <br/>

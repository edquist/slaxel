<h3>Wed Jun 9, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @bbockelm we just ran into another site that doesn't have python3 available (making it two CC* sites by my count), meaning that they're stuck on the crusty bosco-1.3 tarballs<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:39)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I assume it's something like <tt>slurm_status.py</tt> that is now Py3-only?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah and pbs_status.py. turns out the site in this case has it available through <tt>module load python</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i gave JeffP a hack to try but we'll have to talk to Jaime about how we want to support something like that long term<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:46)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Those scripts are ... not long, right?  I assume they are easy to make py2/py3 compatible but it's a matter of the shebang line?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nope, not long. we just made the full python 3 conversion last year and it feels icky to go back to py2/3 compat :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but yeah, we'd also have to figure out a shebang solution<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:43)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> ickiness is a matter of taste<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:00)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> time to convert to Go! then it'll all be statically linked goodness :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:30)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> i think a lot of people do not fully consider the licensing consequences of statically linked binaries<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:56)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thereâ€™s a day-old ops ticket in FreshDesk - anyone able to pick it up?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:01)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @marian is on ops triage, @christinalk do you have a link?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> looks like someone got it<br/>

<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:44)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> hi folks --- what is the github file to add. an extra. line for a hosted CE? Georgia tech now is ready tto accept. ligo VO jobs --- previously there was only OSG<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:56)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i was thinking to do a PR request there<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:29)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi @paschos, I believe new hosted-ce as an entry point for LIGO should go here: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-gfactory/blob/master/10-noncms-osg.xml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-gfactory/blob/master/10-noncms-osg.xml</a> ... Take a peek and see if you can do it, there is quite some lot of other details to be added to the entry point. Feel free to do so when looking at other LIGO entries, but if you get lost open freshdesk ticket against gWMS group and Factory Ops will take care of it. Thanks.<br/>

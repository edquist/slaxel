<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:07)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Hi, any chance someone from ops can take a look at <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/7191">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/7191</a> today?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:00)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> It would be a great help to just glance through a couple of held glidein logs to see if the problem is obvious (I suspect it will be).<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ^ @marian @jdost321<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:48)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I know it's User School and all, so extra thanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, I'll take a peek ... it's actually only me from US now for factory (even not my shift day), others are on the other side of the pond at CHEP ...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Nebraska is proposing a July 23rd downtime for the cloud hosting platform.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:09)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> that gives us 16th to 20th to migrate<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> indeed.  <a href="http://repo-itb.opensciencegrid.org">repo-itb.opensciencegrid.org</a> is already alive on the migrated node.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:48)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> it's not 100% complete, because there's some state involved.  the WN tarballs are not "generated", they are just copied from repo to repo.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> but yes, need to do topology, and a few others.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:50:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (if needed, they can push anvil downtime to week later)<br/>

<h3>Mon Apr 29, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @bbockelm whats the status of OSG's COManage?  We're at the point with the check_mk monitoring that we want a whitelist of users to be able to view it.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Last I heard (which has been in the last 7 days...), it was progressing through UW's purchasing.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not sure this is for operations or software channel ... dealing with Brazil site with "weird" certificate they use and I told them request the InCommon one ... this is what they replied:<br/><pre><br/>Our issuer is ANSP-Grid-CA [1]. We can't get an InCommon certificate because we do not have the funding for that (we're located in Brazil). In fact, our only option in Brazil for now is ANSP.<br/></pre><br/>Is there any $$ involved using InCommon cert, or do I read something wrong? Reference ticket is here: <a href="https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&amp;ticket_id=140774#update#30">https://ggus.eu/index.php?mode=ticket_info&amp;ticket_id=140774#update#30</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> InCommon may be a U.S. thing.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:56)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> and yes, institutions pay for access to InCommon.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:11)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Brazil may have their own issuer.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I would either ask the security mailing list, or search through the CA dist for a brazilian issuer.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:01)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> if they have a Let's Encrypt cert, can they still run non-WLCG jobs?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:53)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yes, though if they found ggus, then they probably want to run WLCG jobs.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's right ^<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:21)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ANSP-Grid-CA is an IGTF CA.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> alright, so I let them figure out with their CA what's going on with the cert, they replaced just few weeks back, if they still keep an old copy of the cert would be worth to compare attributes output with new one, I guess ... or any better idea? seems like any method client requires over SSL using cert doesn't like their server certificate and fail<br/>

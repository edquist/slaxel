<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> hey, I like "freshdesk tickets" option in JIRA, cool! Thanks, @blin or anybody else who added it there!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it's always been there. i don't think we have them linked unless RobG or Suchandra set that up<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:50)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we'll have to think about it before linking them up, imo<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well it's probably there since Freshdesk, not before, right? it's helpful that at least I put link in the ticket, no need re-link ... before we referenced the link in the description which was less convenient place imo<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nope, the old IU jira had it, too<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yea, if it's just linking that's nice but the integration allows for comments to be exchanged and we'd have to look into that more before allowing that<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:18)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah unless it makes jira comments into not-user-visible notes, it might be a bad idea<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, could be I never noticed it since I didn't use Freshdesk ... and actually I also didn't have that enabled in the "create new ticket" window settings ... it's good I know about it now, thanks<br/>

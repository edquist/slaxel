<h3>Mon Dec 14, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:23)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jthiltges @dweitzel - NSF seemed happy with the map changes from Friday (although I'd note map-itb is currently down: something crashing internally?)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:26)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Frank had some qualms with it, however.  Derek, could you make the "everyone is a green dot" view the default?  I think we could roll that to production and argue internally about the other views as needed.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:56)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Do you still want the option to change the view?  Or should that be "hidden"?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:43)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I like the option to change the view - let's keep it<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:49)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm not yet sure on what's broken on map-itb. Apache logs show yaml parsing errors, but the files themselves look fine, and running python to load the yaml works fine. Working on it.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:06)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Ugh. I restart httpd, and map-itb is back to responding normally. (Well, restarted on a single replica, so half-working.)<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:32)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm suspecting perhaps a yaml.CSafeLoader issue, with multiple apps loading the same YAML C library, and stepping on each other's toes. I updated the container apache config to use separate daemon processes, like production topology.<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, things are getting rebalanced as we're adding new nodes and excluding other nodes ... moving data nodes back to anvil (our openstack platfrom) seems like is causing some gracc instabilities ... also, one of the data nodes, unfortunately not the one I'm migrating atm lost it's mind and elasticsearch was simply stuck, I restarted it this morning but health of the whole cluster was already at 80% only ... things will be bit shaky for another day or two I'd say<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:23)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Towards off-site Koji backups for SOFTWARE-3232, I've made an EL7 VM that's totally unconfigured so far: <a href="http://hcc-osg-kojidb.unl.edu">hcc-osg-kojidb.unl.edu</a><br/>Still wondering about the best way to keep the backups safe from the source system, just in case. Best idea so far is ZFS snapshots.<br/>Let me know the next steps whenever it's convenient, @blin, @matyas.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ZFS snapshots seem reasonable to me<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so with this setup you'd just want us to push backups and not have us worry about cleanup?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:28)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Sure, I think. Just overwrite the destination with something equivalent to <tt>rsync --delete</tt>, and make periodic snapshots on the server-side.<br/>

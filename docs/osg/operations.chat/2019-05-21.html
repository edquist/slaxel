<h3>Tue May 21, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:32:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @marian, contacts info is stored in a private Bitbucket repo (for privacy reasons)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:32:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> oh, good to know!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> should I know reference link to that repo of contacts?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:34:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> it's <a href="https://bitbucket.org/opensciencegrid/contact/src/master/">https://bitbucket.org/opensciencegrid/contact/src/master/</a> but I don't think you have access<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:35:08)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> unfortunately there's a limit to the number of users you can have for the free tier of bitbucket<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:36:44)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> you should give tickets like those to me, Carl, Brian Lin, or Edgar<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:37:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's totally fine, I don't need edit access ... so I guessed right I gave the ticket to you ... I wasn't when I said to person they can submit PR, though<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:38:55)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:39:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> sorry. it's a weird system<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:40:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> probably something for the OPS to document what we should do in similar case<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:40:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I guess I add it to the triage ops doc<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:52:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian probably something to add to here: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/services/topology-contacts-data/">https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/services/topology-contacts-data/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:56:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:58:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I think to such request Ops people on triage get in contact from time to time, as I did yesterday, so I thought more on internal note for ourselves what we can do when this kind or update request arrives ... for Ops it would be to know assign some of you ...<br/>

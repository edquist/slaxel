<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> confused from the thread(s) here ... is there anything going in with k8s (Tiger) in general? or is this unrelated? I'm just getting emails from JLAB for example their allocations dropped completelly down but I don't see any issues with Frontend at first glance, which runs in osg-dev space on Tiger<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> there was one drop yesterday that selfrecovered and today they claim same issue<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nope, the issues Lincoln was talking about was related to River<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @huijun.zhu is there an issue with check_mk? i'm seeing<br/>&gt;  OMD: Site Not Started<br/>&gt; You need to start this site in order to access the web interface.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:50)</span> <b>huijun.zhu:</b></span> It happens if you were idling for a while and then refreshed the page. I didnâ€™t find a solution, but it will be available in a few minutes<br/>

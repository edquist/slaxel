<h3>Tue Dec 8, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:52:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> hey - I'm on triage this week - what we usually do with these kind of requests "CI-Connect group membership request" <a href="https://opensciencegrid.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/66438">https://opensciencegrid.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/66438</a> ... I see group is assigned correctly, but not sure who can be Agent here ... Can somebody take it, please?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i imagine if it's assigned to the appropriate group and isn't operations then you don't have to worry about the agent<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:55:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, good, that what I thought just didn't want to leave it without notice since that was opened with "high" priority and 9hrs ago<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:56:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (ok, we don't operate overnight, so just heads up and maybe lower priority)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:57:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if you want, you can ping folks in #facilitation<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:57:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm not in that channel, not sure I should be noisy there :)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:58:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'll keep an eye on it over it and ping later if it stays intact longer<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:58:36)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks, Brian<br/>

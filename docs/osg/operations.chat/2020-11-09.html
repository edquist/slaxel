<h3>Mon Nov 9, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:32)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> For the Omaha datacenter, we're scheduled to have a fire alarm contractor on site at 9am (CST) tomorrow. They plan to disconnect the EPO (emergency power off) connecting the building fire alarm panel to the machine room UPS. We'll also have an UN Omaha electrician and HCC staff member on-site.<br/><br/>We don't anticipate machine room power to be interrupted.<br/><br/>From the campus Fire Safety Officer:<br/>&gt; The fire alarm side of things will be simple from the standpoint that, in the current configuration, a relay gets activated on alarm and disables the power to the UPS.  This can simply (here I go hoping for simple) be removed at the fire panel.  The relay can then be removed at the UPS and this EPO is effectively no longer going to happen.<br/>

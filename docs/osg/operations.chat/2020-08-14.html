<h3>Fri Aug 14, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:01)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I didn't realize we were running collector1.osg and collector2.osg VMs on an NFS backend, rather than Ceph. We'll move collector2 shortly, and then collector1. Should be a short process.<br/>If we run into issues, we'll change the DNS alias of "collector" before moving collector1.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:38)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'll be on "vacation" next week, Aug 17-21. I'll be around, but not on Slack as much. Still feel free to message, but reply times may vary.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks for the heads up!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> thanks, enjoy!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:22:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> hm - collector1 looks slightly broken?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(15:23:56)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Is it? collector2 was rebooted for migration a bit ago, but looked to have recovered. Eric is making a snapshot of collector1 right now, but haven't made any changes yet.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:37)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'd hoped the downtime would be almost invisible, as I moved the floating IP from the old collector2 VM to the new one. =/<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ah.  Looks better now.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:40)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> It was just responding with errors<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I must have been very lucky....<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:54)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm going to swap the collector1.osg IP over to the new VM. :crossed_fingers:<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:46)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Things look OK. Please let me know if you notice any issues.<br/>

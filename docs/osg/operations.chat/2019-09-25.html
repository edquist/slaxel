<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(02:40:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not sure why they would need to set up a condor pool just to submit to the OSG<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(02:41:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think we should avoid creating more work for the admin to get their users ramped up<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(03:12:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The idea is that campuses/groups/gateways can have local submit nodes, with local users/filesystems/policies/...<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(03:14:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think OSG still has some bigger picture work here, but in general do we want to be a remote differently admined entity users log into, or a local entity which feels like home?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(03:18:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> sure but if they're starting from scratch with the OSG but have outgrown OSG Connect, then the next logical step would be their own flocking submit node without a local pool<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(03:18:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if they get resources to have their own cluster, they can always add them after they set up the OSG submit host<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:45)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> If they've outgrown osg-connect, how would setting up their own osg-connect help?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> they wouldn't be setting up their own osg-connect, they'd be setting up their own osg submit host<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> "outgrown" can be things like "the local institution wants to provide the user support directly".<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> even just having their own private submit host could be beneficial<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:57)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> even if it's flocking-only?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:17)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:29)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> you can put your institution's homedirs and users on the submit host, for example<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and access to local ceph/gluster/whatever<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:00)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> i would think of it as an HTC outlet for an HPC env<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:19)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> The flocking docs say users still need to register a project if they're flocking to OSG. The current instructions just say 'open a ticket'. What info should they put in the ticket? Same thing as listed on <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634360-start-or-join-a-project-in-osg-connect">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634360-start-or-join-a-project-in-osg-connect</a>?<br/>

<h3>Tue Oct 20, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:10)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm doing some cleanup of the puppet config for hcc-osg-repo. It serves display.osg, repo.osg, and <a href="http://repo.gridcf.org">repo.gridcf.org</a>.<br/>I'm not anticipating any problems, but there may be a short outage if I've overlooked nginx details.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:09)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> There was a brief 404 error for display.osg, but sorted out. Everything seems OK from my quick testing.<br/>

<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:20)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I know @bbockelm and @dweitzel have been playing with some of the automation rules<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> normally i see freshdesk highlight comments if it has issues sending an email<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:02)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I don't know of anything that we've been doing which would affect that.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:26)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> hmm maybe its ucsd mail server side then<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:13)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah, looks like FreshDesk thinks it sent the email.<br/>

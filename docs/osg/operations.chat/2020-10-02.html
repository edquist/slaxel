<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I've got a ticket from Brown (a CMS T3) asking for their xrootd server to be added to topology: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64802">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64802</a><br/>Anybody know what service type I should use? At first I was guessing "XRootD component" but they're trying to get onto this XML page: <a href="https://cmssst.web.cern.ch/cmssst/vofeed/vofeed.xml">https://cmssst.web.cern.ch/cmssst/vofeed/vofeed.xml</a> and the services that are marked there as "XROOTD" are actually "SRMv2" in topology. Any hints? I'm confused.<br/>

<h3>Fri Jan 8, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:15)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> UNL has some emergency fiber work happening tomorrow (Jan 9th) between 10am and 2pm Central time. This will likely make UNLâ€™s Internet2 connections hiccup briefly multiple times during that window. There is a backup path to I2, and in the past the impact has been minimal for similar maintenance. This is purely a heads up in case folks notice anything tomorrow.<br/>

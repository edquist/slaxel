<h3>Tue Sep 18, 2018 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Everyone remember when we moved things for the HCC Cloud Downtime?  Well, we got hit for not moving things back fast enough.  A storage service for only the moved services was unaccessible over night, so some services went belly up.  So far, the list is collector1, topology-itb.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:53)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Check_mk didn't catch the collector1, as it's apparently not in check_mk.  And topology-itb is ITB, so also not in check_mk (though, the production is...)<br/>

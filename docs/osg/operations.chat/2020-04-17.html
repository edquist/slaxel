<h3>Fri Apr 17, 2020 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:02)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I'm planning a condor update, webserver reconfig, and general OS update/reboot on <a href="http://collector2.opensciencegrid.org">collector2.opensciencegrid.org</a>. (FD#64791)<br/>There should be no noticeable impact, as clients are configured to advertise to both collector1 and collector2.<br/>I'll follow up here when it's complete.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:04)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> collector2.osg changes are complete. Clients seem to be reporting OK. (164 of 173 are already back, with more trickling in.)<br/>Website is now SSL-enabled, and proxied through Apache.<br/>

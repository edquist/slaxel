<h3>Tue Oct 15, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:44)</span> <b>ztzhang:</b></span> We are scheduling an anvil headnode downtime next week. The headnode will have software and firmware update and rebooted. The VMs running on compute nodes will be unaffected. You just can't create new ones during the maintenance. I'll let you know the details later<br/>

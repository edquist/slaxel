<h3>Wed Mar 10, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:49:38)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> <b>@here</b> FYI I just pushed a significant update to /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org, changing the configurations of every supported domain to include world-wide stratum 1s and to accept the original keys in addition to the OSG key.  I donâ€™t expect anybody to notice, but if problems occur with accessing cvmfs repositories let me know<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(13:50:34)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> A little later OSG will stop re-signing imported repositories with the OSG key on our stratum 1<br/>

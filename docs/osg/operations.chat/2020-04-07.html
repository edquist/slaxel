<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I think the stashcache dashboard may be broken: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/9fd2afb95359971405f0d0c6945535d2">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/9fd2afb95359971405f0d0c6945535d2</a><br/>It's just giving me :neutral_face: No results found<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> you're right, the xrootd stash collector was down.  I received an email a while ago about some issue, then it left my mind.  I'll ask for check_mk monitoring, since it can send reminder emails if it continues to fail.<br/>

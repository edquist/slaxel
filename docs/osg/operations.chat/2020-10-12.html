<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Freshdesk gurus -- is there a good way to suppress the "customer response" label without responding back to the customer (see: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64836">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64836</a>; they wrote back "Ok, thanks for the update" and I'd prefer to just suppress the label than fill their inbox with a trivial ACK).<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:59:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't think so, that's why i try to rely on ticket state more than that "label"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ok, vacuous update it is!  :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

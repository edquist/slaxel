<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(10:02:30)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @lmichael is this the channel where I should watch for OSG school issues?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:21)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> We should invite you to the School Slack?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:50)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Actually, you’re already there.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> The private #staff channel there is key.<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:17)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> This slack interface doesn't seem to have the school slack - maybe I signed into it at home?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:16)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Uh … so I guess I invite you again? That seems wrong.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:32)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> <a href="http://osgschool.slack.com">osgschool.slack.com</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @bbockelm i'm seeing some internal server errors in the harbor project UI and @matyas had some issues pushing earlier this morning. Are there known issues?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:01)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> No known issues but I can take a peek in 10<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:42)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> In the meantime, can you identify any failing API for when it is in this state?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:57)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> fwiw I also got an internal server error trying to login via fed identity<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> just got out of a meeting, i can take a look in a few<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:42)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I just kicked things over because the API discovery endpoint was behind the login :cry:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:53)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> For the future, here's the relevant URL:<br/><pre>curl -X GET "<a href="https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/api/v2.0/health">https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/api/v2.0/health</a>" -H "accept: application/json" | jq</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh gotcha. seems like an easy thing to throw into check_mk!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Now, unfortunately, I don't know if this particular failure mode was caught by this API endpoint ... but one way to find out!<br/>

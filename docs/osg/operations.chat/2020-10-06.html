<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hi <b>@here</b> - forgot to mention it at standup but, thanks to @dweitzel, you can now associate a JIRA ticket with a FreshDesk ticket from inside FreshDesk.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> If done, when comments are made in JIRA for linked tickets they are automatically added as notes in FreshDesk.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:55:46)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The first part of this article describes how to use the integration: <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/50000000067-the-jira-plus-app">https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/50000000067-the-jira-plus-app</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> That's kinda neat. We should make sure that Freshdesk comments _don't_ automatically become JIRA comments though, because Freshdesk tickets are private and JIRA is public...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @matyas - yes, we were looking at the reverse integration (having FreshDesk info show up in JIRA tickets) and decided that it wasn't feasible because of privacy issues.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> If that wasn't a problem, the FreshDesk-inside-JIRA integration is quite slick.<br/>

<h3>Fri Aug 27, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:59)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @jdost321 @bbockelm I have a ticket <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67895">here</a> initiated by @colby (potential <tt>agent</tt> , but <tt>contact</tt> in this case because he opened the ticket) that is pending response.  What's the correct way to handle this?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Colby wasn't an agent when i tossed that to Ops this morning. It should probably belong to him now that he's an agent<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:10)</span> <b>colby:</b></span> I made myself the agent<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:28)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> Yeah, I had to remove <tt>Operations</tt> from the <tt>Group</tt> field to set Colby as agent<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oops, let me add him to the ops group<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:04)</span> <b>colby:</b></span> oh sorry meant I was goint to make myself the agent. Never hit update<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:13)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> np<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> done. you guys can move the ticket back to the ops group now<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:44)</span> <b>colby:</b></span> :+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:32)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> My question still stands though;  what should be done when an agent is initiating a ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:53)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> It really seems to break the agent-contact model and throws reporting off<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:26)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @moate i think in that case we want to change the initial contact of the ticket to who the agent was reaching out to in the first place<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:59)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> i've found it also messes up first responses. an agent who is also first contact can't first response themselves FD still interprets that as waitig on first response<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(12:01:01)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> somewhat buried in the ... button there's an option "edit ticket details" that's where we can change the contact<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup. i think this case is annoying though because we got email bounces from shawn iirc<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:37)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> right.. doesn't help if the person we're trying to contact has left<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> in these cases where we're initiating emails, there's a difference between "new ticket" and "new email" that will set the owner of the ticket to the customer<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i forget which one's the right one...email maybe?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:16)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @colbyâ€™s initial tickets were special in that they did originate from email.. since he wasn't an agent he was cc'ing <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a> but yes, moving forward as agent I think these types of tickets he'll want to open "as email" from teh FD interface<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:47)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> when its an agent reaching out to an external person<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:02)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> OK;  Should <tt>Groups</tt> field be <tt>Operations - External</tt>?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:26)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> thats a good question. @bbockelm do you have an opinion for when tx originate from us to an external user? should we be putting thsee in the new external group?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:09)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Nope, should be <tt>Operations</tt>.  The <tt>Operations - External</tt> group is for when we're facilitating communications but not doing any work (e.g., doesn't count against ticket metrics).<br/>

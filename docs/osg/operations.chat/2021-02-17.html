<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jdost321 @jdost321 we're now pushing <tt>testing</tt> and <tt>release</tt> tags (with corresponding timestamp tags, too). are there any CEs that would be a good candidates to try the new tags on?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> note that when poking around just now, I think I found a bug in the gratia accounting: we don't clean up the CE job history files because of a permission issue<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so a good candidate may be a long-lived or busy CE so we don't hit any k8s storage limits<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:32:32)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @dweitzel FYI: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66973">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66973</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:03:04)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Thanks lauren, got it.  I think Brian answered the question well.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jpeterson you said you had some questions about bosco?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> FWIW, you shoudl still carry around that workaround for overriding the bosco tarball url. we haven't had time to test the new one, especially with some excitement last week about the condor team having to pull condor 8.9.12<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:24)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> Was there anything else with Expanse?  Jeff said you did a re-install on the CE?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> for xenon i had to clear out the old bosco installation and re-run the bosco setup commands manually<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not really sure how we ended up in that state but we had decided not to try to figure it out/fix it at the time because it was working and there was the xenon allocation time crunch<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so if you're going to redeploy, i'd look at each of the remote user's bosco installations and make sure things like the local attr symlinks are all there<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:28)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> okay, so if I clear all the bosco dirs from users before redeply that should be okay?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:35)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> and then check after<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if they're not, we've got a bug<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, that should work<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:05)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> need to clean up CMS and add in the xdlogin one, and Xenon should be done now<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Pilots in the OS pool seem to have fallen significantly today:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:14)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;from=now-7d&amp;to=now&amp;var-VOName=osg&amp;var-Facility=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;from=now-7d&amp;to=n[…]ility=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:23)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Todd T. had another view, but I think that’s behind UW–Madison login.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:34)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Maybe a few days:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:36)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:52)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Any thoughts <b>@here</b>?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:42)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I do see a fairly large drop in SU pilots, maybe that is a chunk of it?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:48)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Has anyone reached out to them?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We turned off the COVID19 entries - that would probably do it as some sites only supported COVID19 workloads, and not OSG VO in general<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tannenba ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:42)</span> <b>tannenba:</b></span> @rynge et all - the monitor view I was looking at was specific to pilots running at a CCStar site (according to topology), and the drop happened back on Tuesday morning (specifically, around 9:45am central 3/30).  Does removing the COVID19-only sites potentially explain this CCStar drop on Tuesday?   Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> potentially since Syracuse provides the bulk of CC* pilot hours and IIRC they were giving COVID-19 pilots prio in their pool<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Well we know at least one CCStar site which was set up for COVID19 jobs only (AMNH)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:30)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Which site are we talking about here?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:06)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I don’t see any recent drop in AMNH pilot hours here: &lt;<a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000079/site-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-interval=$__auto_interval_interval&amp;var-site=AMNH&amp;var-type=Batch">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000079/site-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-interval=$__auto_interval_interval&amp;var-site=AMNH&amp;var-type=Batch</a>&gt;.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:17)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Would that catch the COVID-19 pilots?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:45)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Or here &lt;<a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-VOName=All&amp;var-Facility=AMNH&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-VOName=All&amp;v[…]lity=AMNH&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d</a>&gt;.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Factory ops was going to update the entries. Also AMNH has a Singularity config issue as well, so not sure history is good measurement here.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:25)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm interested in trying to figure out which CC*s saw a decline<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We also have had a few sites mentioned they are not getting jobs - most of the time because we have run of "simple" jobs, and only have jobs requiring modules or singularity (which means /cvmfs for us)<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:47)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Syracuse is usually classified as a CC* campus, and it does appear that they’ve had a decline recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:24)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> &lt;<a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000079/site-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-interval=$__auto_interval_interval&amp;var-site=SU%20ITS&amp;var-type=Batch">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000079/site-summary?orgId=1&amp;var-interval=$__auto_interval_interval&amp;var-site=SU%20ITS&amp;var-type=Batch</a>&gt;<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:46)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> They have averaged 523 Khrs/day over the past 30 days, but posted 348 Khrs yesterday.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:55)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What I _don’t_ see is an overall drop in OSG-VO pilot hours. SU dropped a bunch, but others filled in.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Any chance that the WAY Syracuse was co figured for COVID is relevant? Would regular OSG VO pilots take the place of what used to be running for COVID?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, i suspect that they gave COVID pilots priority<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:37)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Syracuse is pretty easy to deal with - we should just ask Eric<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we could just ask Eric, he's on this slack. but given the conversations about Slack, i'm not quite sure if we should invite him to this channel or what<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:45:46)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> DM with the few relevant peeps? (I’m not one of them. Going back to vacation now... :)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @marian that LIGO ticket about wanting arch-specific containers seems like an FE thing<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, I was thinking of it further<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe requiring customizations to the singularity wrapper for them? idk what specifies which container to startup in the gwms pipeline<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> all we had is in this config on the frontend side: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/blob/master/manifests/production/vo-frontend-igwn/frontend.xml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/blob/master/manifests/production/vo-frontend-igwn/frontend.xml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm not entirely sure what to do there with that request, though ... anyway, seems like more people start to contribute to the discussion at <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67055">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67055</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok in that case i'm going to pass it back to you and Ops since this seems like a glideinwms config or potentially an htcondor issue<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:36)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sure<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sorry to bother previously :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<h3>Sat Mar 2, 2019 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:28:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hi folks - could someone urgently look into the Gratia probe for the TACC hosted CE?  It's doing that thing where it's reporting each Stampede worker node as a separate GRACC site - quickly polluting the numbers<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Also - GRACC reports NET2 is 50% larger than UChicago... &lt;~ @lincoln.  Seems fishy.<br/>

<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:47)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I could probably look at the CE if I knew whichone it was and what to do :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> On a Saturday?  Probably falls into the "important to note, not important to fix"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:44:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Saturdays are for impromptu cluster upgrades, after all.<br/>

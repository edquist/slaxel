<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:47)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> hi, UChicago got back to me regarding the DNS record for flock<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:59)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> here's what they sent:<br/>&gt;The issue is that -- even before the DCV process can get started -- InCommon looks at the WHOIS record to be sure the domain is associated. But of course the WHOIS record is not affiliated in any way with our institution. So the InCommon process that we normally follow won't enable us to move forward with DCV -- the domain is literally grayed out and not approved. So unfortunately, we don't believe we can make this happen with our InCommon certificates.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dweitzel how were you guys able to get it to work?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:10)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there's that document that you have for how you did it with UNL<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:21)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I sent Lincoln that document. <br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:35)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Not sure how it was done. It was done by our IT. <br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:50)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Getting deep in the weeds that Iâ€™m not familiar with. <br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:31:44)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> could you ask them about the process?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it sounds like a crock of shit<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> esp because godaddy recently limited access to their WHOIS info so even UW had us set up DCV to validate our ownership of <a href="http://opensciencegrid.org">opensciencegrid.org</a><br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:44)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> Hi, I joined the meeting late because I was in the zone and haven't been attending as many meetings lately; according to @lincoln the MWT2 outage was caused by the application of a bad iptables rule. Beyond what Lincoln is reporting above and the propagation of the new Rucio instances I don't think we have anything to report at this time. Sorry for the hiccup : )<br/>

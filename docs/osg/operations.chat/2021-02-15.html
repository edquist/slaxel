<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The power provider for Lincoln, NE is implementing rolling power blackouts.  We don't know how that will affect the Lincoln HCC data center.  Not many OSG services are hosted in the Lincoln data center.  OASIS may be the only one.  No word on the Omaha data center yet.  The Omaha power provider is different from Lincoln, and Omaha's has not announced anything like the Lincoln provider.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:08)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> If we hear anything substantial, we will update here and the OSG status page: <a href="https://status.opensciencegrid.org/">https://status.opensciencegrid.org/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:38)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Sorry for the ignorance here … is this because of a storm?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:28)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> “LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - Lincoln Electric System said it will pause planned power outages but customers need to remain prepared.<br/>LES started the rolling outages around 12:10 p.m. due to “an unprecedented energy demand.“, and put a pause on them around 1:40 p.m.”<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:20)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Huh, I guess it’s cold there?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:22)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It's because of the weather.  Nebraska is part of the "The 17-state Southwest Power Pool", which includes places like texas.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:30)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ahhhh<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> So Texans are freezing and cranking up their heat pumps…<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:17)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Interesting. The systems we put in place and their interconnections.<br/>

<h3>Tue Jul 6, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> can't press "update" button in the Freshdesk, I'm logged in, is there any issue with Freshdesk in general?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ticket: 67489<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> seems to work for me<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:37)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and now for me, too! weird...<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:39)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> My mental model of CVMFS was that a site that supported it included _all_ data that OSG helps provide via CVMFS. But LIGO is asking questions about OS Pool use that suggests a different model — one in which LIGO data (even their “open” data) may be available only at certain CVMFS instances. Which is correct?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:16)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> There are some sites (particularly in Europe) that don't follow the OSG configuration and on these you sometimes have to beg to get a certain repo mounted..<br/>

<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:35)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Seems to be especially true of the <a href="http://osgstorage.org">osgstorage.org</a> repos since those aren't included in the default cvmfs rpms (they're in OASIS of course but not the cvmfs-config-default package or whatever it's called).<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We check a bunch of repos for that reason<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:43)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> IIRC, LIGO needs a specific proxy to access their embargod data<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That will not work in the open pool<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:58)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> My question is about their open data.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:45)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Is there a way to write a requirements expression (or something like that) to run only on resources that have access to a given CVMFS repository?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <tt><a href="http://gwosc.osgstorage.org">gwosc.osgstorage.org</a></tt> or something else?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> In the Open Pool, we check for individual repos so you can do <tt>HAS_CVMFS_gwosc_osgstorage_org =?= True</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:33)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ah, perfect. And yes, I believe that is the repo.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> gwosc is the open data.  <a href="http://ligo.osgstorage.org">ligo.osgstorage.org</a> is the embargoed data.  But, <a href="http://ligo.osgstorage.org">ligo.osgstorage.org</a> requires a certificate (or now a SciToken) to access data.  That certificate comes from the user, not from the pilot, so it doesn't matter where the pilot is from, OSPool or LIGO pool, as long as the user has the certificate with the job, it will work.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:41)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Has LIGO allowed users to run on the OS Pool with embargoed data?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:16:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Don't know, but there's nothing stopping them from accessing the CVMFS repo with embargoed data from the OS Pool.<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> what's the difference between the "OSG hosted services contact list" (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F98uwkoylg7vdbqq2ml7gXx9ijVNVMI23AdLXBqO5B4/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F98uwkoylg7vdbqq2ml7gXx9ijVNVMI23AdLXBqO5B4/edit#gid=0</a>) and  the "OSG Service Catalog" (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cIu0YcNAT8Kiy5u2xBz8ZzG2zImVK3pRX9iFHegIjUk/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cIu0YcNAT8Kiy5u2xBz8ZzG2zImVK3pRX9iFHegIjUk/edit#gid=0</a>) and which one should I use?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> the former we're still forming and it's meant to whom should be contacted on first place when check_mk triggers critical status for given service ... the latter, is more official and suggest how escalation should flow if you have any question related to the service ... e.g. contact service owners ... for check_mk I think @jdost321 said on one of our OSG Ops call we'd need to have separate meeting and define proper contact for check_mk(s) ... What I was suggesting earlier was use service owner contact but that may not be accurate in certain cases ... that's why separate talk on the subject and then we decide ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so to answer your question @matyas, I'd say use "OSG Service Catalog" information for now<br/>

<h3>Thu Sep 13, 2018 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> who owns JIRA management? should we switch projects like "OSG Oasis" to somebody else than steige? there are more like this, but as I start to care more about tickets assigned to OO project it would be preferable change this either to Ops lead or somebody who cares...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> <b>@here</b>, ideas? ^<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian can you provide a list of jira projects you're concerned about and remind me next week?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sure, this particular one just came to my attention, haven't closely look at other projects...<br/>

<h3>Thu Nov 29, 2018 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:53:13)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> We need to swap out an optic @ Nebraska at ~9:30am CST today. This only affects our Lincoln, NE datacenter (CVMFS yes, GRACC no) and should take 30 seconds at most. Just an FYI as the OSG related monitoring we host at UNL is mostly in Lincoln and will likely trigger a few errors. In TCP we trust!<br/>

<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:31)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> ^ above outage done. Ended up being two ~30 second outages as the new optic wasnâ€™t as powerful as the old and we had to remove an attenuator we had in place. All done now, so future alerts are probably worth investigating.<br/>

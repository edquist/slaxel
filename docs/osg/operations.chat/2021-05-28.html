<h3>Fri May 28, 2021 : #operations (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:12)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Omaha should be back up and running as of around 1145pm CDT last night. Didn't want to officially announce it without more rested eyes to look things over. The culprit was a line card failure. And this time, power cycling and reseating the card did not get it working again.<br/><br/>For the moment, I've moved the card another slot on the chassis and it seems stable so far. We're working toward replacing the entire device but haven't completed it yet.<br/>

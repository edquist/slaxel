<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin it looks like we’ve set up CEs for USF in the past. Will they need to ‘meet’ to get this CE up and running?  <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66449">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66449</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, pass that off to Ops and probably assign Jeff P<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I can just hand it to Ops, and then do a check-in in January (might be good to have a high-level discussion about their ongoing objectives w/OSG?)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:05)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (this channel probably isn't the right place to discuss this, this was specifically for coordinating development of the CE used to support WeNMR pilots submitting into the OS pool)<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:09)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> is it pretty much over? can I trim my channel list a bit?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, why not<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> sure, i guess? i don't really remember what their onboarding process entailed so it wouldn't hurt<br/>

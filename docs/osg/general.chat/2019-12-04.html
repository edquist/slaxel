<h3>Wed Dec 4, 2019 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> who has the secret sauce for routing jobs to Cancer Computer? @rynge? @blin?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, that should be @rynge<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think there also may be some coordination needed at the factory level, too<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:41)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It is really just a list of white listed projects<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Currently I don't think we have any active users, which means the glideins startup, and never receives any jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I probably should make this a custom group in the frontend instead<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:22:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Frank and Miron want me to get a bunch of UW-Madison projects set up to run on Cancer Computer.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> did we ever decide on a standard way to do this that's not a pain for @rynge (or any other frontend admins) to maintain?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Just give me a list of projects for now<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:11)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m working on that - still need to check with Brian Lin on  topology syntax that can still be traced to our CHTC “project” equivalent and not collide with other OSG projects. So, my understanding is that I need to (1) create projects for them in topology, (2) have you add the project names to the Cancer Computer ‘list’, and then (3) have them submit (as usual) via the GLOW VO with ProjectName set in the job ad?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin Can I have two underscores in a OSG project name? For example, if we have “BMI_Gitter” for one of our CHTC research groups, can I have them use “Wisconsin_BMI_Gitter”, or should they go with “Wisconsin_BMIGitter” ?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (Nearly all of our CHTC project names are “Department_PILastName”)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:59)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> The system accepts it<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:30)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I don't know if we've nailed down a naming scheme...<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:03:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @lmichael the white list is per frontend, so glow would have to maintain it in their config<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:04:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hint: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-flock/blob/master/flock.opensciencegrid.org/frontend-template.xml#L23">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-flock/blob/master/flock.opensciencegrid.org/frontend-template.xml#L23</a><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:04:54)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> You probably also have to add glow to the supported VOs on those sites<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:06:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Also, our setup with the CancerComputer is to give them a list of projects+descriptions, and let us know which ones should be whitelisted<br/>

<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:02)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Hi OSG Folks, we (Caltech) want to scale to AWS Resources. We have all infrastructure in place and able to run, but squid proxy is not registered in OSG Topology. Is it needed to register it?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:14)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I spun up new squids and just now realized I didn't put them in the topology, but they work fine anyway, so :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:28)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> (I need to go through vanderbilt's and clean house)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:57)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> The squid proxy is used just for your worker nodes, right?<br/>I don’t think there is a need to register it per OSG rules<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:18)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> But it may be necessary for CMS jobs… but I would expect this is not the right forum for that<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:16)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> CMS just wants it in SITECONF<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:38)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> WLCG ops gets mad if you don't register squids<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so please do :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:01)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> Turns out that if you don't register it's hard for them to catch you. Not that I would have any experience with that. . .<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:31:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> er, they definitely notice the ones that aren't registered<br/>

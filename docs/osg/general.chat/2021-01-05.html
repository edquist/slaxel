<h3>Tue Jan 5, 2021 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge @blin Are our Carpentries-templated training pages still using features that we’re being ‘charged’ for? Where are we on potential migration?<br/>example page: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/dHTC-Campus-Workshop-2020/">https://opensciencegrid.org/dHTC-Campus-Workshop-2020/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, it's still using travis<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i thought we were having a meeting about it with @jmvera at some point? i lost the thread on it though<br/>

<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:45)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> yes, this wednesday at 3pm<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh there it is right in my calendar lol<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:13)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @blin how is it using travis? I don’t think it’s needed to build - if we just removed the .travis.yaml file would it stop using it?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah if you delete that it'll stop using travis<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not familiar with exactly what it's doing though. latest run here: <a href="https://travis-ci.com/github/opensciencegrid/dHTC-Campus-Workshop-2020">https://travis-ci.com/github/opensciencegrid/dHTC-Campus-Workshop-2020</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it looks like it may just be doing some sort of check?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:20)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think it’s just running tests<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cbrown58 needs to make some changes, anyway, so is going to test the effect of deleting the .travis.yaml file in her own fork<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin the Facilitation GitHub meeting is tomorrow 3pm <a href="https://https">https://https</a>:&lt;//www.google.com/url?q=https://uwmadison.zoom.us/j/93656708308&gt; (I see you in the calendar entry)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it can be hard to test CI changes in your own fork, esp if the CI uses creds that are only associated with the main fork<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and depending whether or not your own fork is otherwise hooked up to the CI provider<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:59)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> the main test is if the page still renders _sans_ travis file, which should work on a fork.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> anyone know how to do in-line responses in the freshdesk UI?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:44:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (prepare in-line response in your email client and then copy/paste as reply to FD GUI, that's how I do it ;))<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:48)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> aren’t there three dots at the bottom of the compose window that allow you to expand previous reponses?<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Yup but when I try to add some text as a response outside of the quote, it adds it to the inside of the quote :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:06)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> well that’s silly<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:48:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> always hassle then with formatting<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I like plain text edits which I couldn't find in FD, but maybe I just didn't find that option?<br/>

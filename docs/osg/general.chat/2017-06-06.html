<h3>Tue Jun 6, 2017 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:32)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all, a little while ago I made some administrative changes to the info listed in OIM; mainly I changed the name of my resource group and CE resource.  OIM etc looks fine, but I noticed that gracc doesn't seem to have sync'ed this info yet (at least not fully).  Have I missed any steps or is this just something that takes time?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> hm - might be a good question for the #gracc channel.  I would have expected it to change relatively quickly (as the summary data is recomputed every hour or so).<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:09)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> it's partly there, I think; if I look at the "site summary" it shows nothing for payload (and did so almost immediately after I updated the names), but if I look at the Payload Jobs Summary, its still showing my old resource name (and the job stats are accumulating under it).  I'll enquire in #gracc for more info<br/>

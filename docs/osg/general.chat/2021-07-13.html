<blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @luehring, Horst was satisfied with RC3 and I believe we've had some XCache testing that went well. 5.3.0 has officially been released and it's available in 3.5 upcoming testing<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:00)</span> <b>luehring:</b></span> Cool…<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:12)</span> <b>luehring:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:41)</span> <b>luehring:</b></span> Should I send questions like this one to you privately?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nah, it's nice to have q&amp;a out in public! but #software is probably the more appropriate channel<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:52)</span> <b>luehring:</b></span> OK I will take my questions there in the future.<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:17:27)</span> <b>luehring:</b></span> We aren’t having the usual meeting tomorrow so I am asking here.<br/>

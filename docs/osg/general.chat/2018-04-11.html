<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:22)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> Hey all! If anyone hasn’t heard, the IU portion of OSG operations is shuttering its doors, and I think I speak for everyone here when I say you’re a great community that I’ve enjoyed working with and with the research computing community being such a small world, I’ll probably see you all around in some other capacity at some point. Thanks for everything.<br/>

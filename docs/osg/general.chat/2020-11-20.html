<h3>Fri Nov 20, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m not exactly sure how to handle <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66216">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66216</a>, currently owned to @pam. Does anyone have any idea of the answer to Shawn’s question,  or who in OSG should ‘own’ getting it to him? (We’re also trying for a culture shift to get contacts like Shawn used to emailing <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a>, so it would be good to keep the communication in-thread.)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think you mean to @paschos<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:41)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> In the end, I think Edgar would be the one to answer Shawn's question.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:10)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> yeah --- i thought it was an email but i see now it created somehow a ticket. I can provide an answer to shawn over the ticket system by COB today--- but @efajardo should chime in for a complete answer … i asked him to take a look as well just in case he can respond before i do<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:05)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> edgar already replied to the email… we can drop the answer in the ticket system as well<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:25)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I cannot emphasize enough how much we (even Frank agrees) need to force these conversations into FreshDesk, and develop individual practices of using the interface (not just email).<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:58)</span> <b>smckee:</b></span> Thanks, I think the whole set of info ended up in <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/1ae89b3de8c806195e3e1cd0bb955fb2587f5555442d7a810595244536d06389">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/1ae89b3de8c806195e3e1cd0bb955fb2587f5555442d7a810595244536d06389</a><br/>

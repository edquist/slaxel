<h3>Wed Mar 17, 2021 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:53)</span> <b>eric.appelt:</b></span> I have been on the phone with DigiCert all morning as we needed to renew the host certificates on six of our xrootd servers at Vanderbilt that expired today, and after a lot of escalation they have told me that as of now they are unable to issue grid certificates, and currently have no ETA or path forward for the service.<br/><br/>There is something with the CAB rules that has deprecated their CAs - I'm still trying to understand and they will be providing us with more information.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @eric.appelt - oh dear!  Do we need to execute on the backup route of getting <tt>*.<a href="http://opensciencegrid.org">opensciencegrid.org</a></tt> certs for Vandy?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:20)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> We might need to if DigiCert can't figure it out<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @stanfiem -&gt; would you be able to bring this up via TAGPMA?  Would be good to get DigiCert to make a public statement on this.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:08)</span> <b>eric.appelt:</b></span> They may be able to work around CAB rules if there are private options or something like that (I don't fully understand the terminology here)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:08)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Any reason why we _shouldn't_ pull the trigger on the backup plan now and just hope DigiCert figures it out in parallel?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:28)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> sure, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting on DigiCert<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:58)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I think Brian's right and we should pull the trigger, unfortunately<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:59)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin - do you have the institutional memory on what we did last time?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:23)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we had to set up DNS entries, get the CSRs from vanderbilt, and pass them along to UW IT<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:47)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Didn't we also write up ourselves a policy?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe? i don't recall doing that, though<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:04)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> To the email archives we go!  @andrew.melo - do you recall the DNS hostname from last time?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:24)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> <a href="http://vanderbilt-ce1.sites.opensciencegrid.org">vanderbilt-ce1.sites.opensciencegrid.org</a> Ithink<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:32)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I just got off with Oli so I can focus a bit more now<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, we still have a bunch of vandy DNS entries<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ah, found the conversation thread.  it was actually <tt><a href="http://ce1-vanderbilt.sites.opensciencegrid.org">ce1-vanderbilt.sites.opensciencegrid.org</a></tt><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:19)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Looks like we went through the CA policy with a fine-tooth-comb and decided this was acceptable but never wrote a policy for it.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (that reminds me @andrew.melo, i need to bug you about gridftp-vanderbilt.sites)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:56)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Uhoh<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> What is the buggng about?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i was wondering how long you'd run gridftp and need the DNS :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:29)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face: well, I guess we should leave it around for a bit longer, considering....<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:12)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I dunno if it makessense to just go ahead and make DNS/certs for all the hosts in one swoop so you don't have to deal withit repeatedly<br/>

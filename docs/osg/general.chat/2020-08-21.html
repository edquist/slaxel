<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:24)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <b>@here</b> there’s a ticket for the GlideinWMS (?) team in freshdesk where someone is requesting a meeting.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> got a link?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:57)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65536">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65536</a><br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:53)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> Thanks @christinalk! I'm aware of this issue on another ticket, I see some times are already proposed. I'll make sure I or someone from factory ops joins<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:54)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @blin this is related to the site that has troubles with setting X509_CERT_DIR in the job router you should probably join as well<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:46)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yeah, Brian and I were just talking about it. I think the mail was originally supposed to go to me because it says Ken Herner &lt;<a href="mailto:usersupport@opensciencegrid.org">usersupport@opensciencegrid.org</a>&gt;<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:07)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> So somehow Helio has the User Support address as my email I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah we get that a bunch with folks' email clients =/<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:28)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think we need to change that freshdesk setting<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <tt>Use agent names in ticket replies and outbound emails</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But I will not change it unless there is some agreement<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:31)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’d be okay with changing it!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Reading it again, I'm not sure it is the right one<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We would need to try it<br/>

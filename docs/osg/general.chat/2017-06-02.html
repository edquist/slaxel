<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:00)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all, adding some additional WNs to my CE today; systems are similar but they have a -slightly- different CPU (E5645 vs L5640); number of cpus / cores, amount of ram is the same though.  How homogeneous do the systems need to be in each subcluster specification of 30-gip.ini?  The only difference really is a clock of 2.4GHz vs 2.27GHz..  Based on the mandatory bits listed in the twiki docs it looks like i should be fine to get away with both cpu types in the same subcluster; just want to confirm..<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:42)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Oh, I wouldn't worry about the difference (unless you want to support a fairly particular VO?).<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:11)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> OSG is effectively the only VO i'm supporting, and it doesn't look like they're picky..  I wasn't sure if anything in gracc might care about CPU profiles or if it matters for other misc accounting, though<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:26)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Nope, OSG VO doesn't really look at that information.  The accounting uses only the output from your batch system (unless you are a CMS / ATLAS site).  I think you should be set!<br/>

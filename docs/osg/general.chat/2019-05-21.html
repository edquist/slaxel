<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hi @andrew.melo It’s Amol Jaikar who is part of sPHENIX via BNL affiliation (he has a bnl email address). I’ll give him your name. Should I give your email address?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:47)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'm speaking with Amol in an email thread -- does sphoenix not have a VO?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:15)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m not sure about the status of an xphoenix VO, but @dweitzel and @blin are two people who might readily know/find the answer.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> also, @andrew.melo I’m not seeing your replies in the email thread, if you’re intending to include an OSG support email address.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> they do not, it's a project within the OSG VO: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/sPHENIX.yaml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/sPHENIX.yaml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:30)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> well, I started a thread with Chris Pinkerburg, who I guess is the sphoenix computing lead or something, and amol got added to that -- not sure why he started a thread with OSG and didn't add me, but feel free to put me in<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin or others, what can we do about all the spammy russian tix coming into FreshDesk? I’ve created a rule that seemed to be working, and it SHOULD be covering these tix, but it’s not.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We’ve got nearly 200 of these just in the last several hours.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:38:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> are you in CS? it's easy to mark tickets as spam and block their email addresses<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:38:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> for 200 of them? there’s a new one each minute, roughly<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:38:38)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> are they all from different email addresses?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:03)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> They’re not being blocked, so presumably? Either that, for FreshDesk spam blocking isn’t working.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you can select multiple tickets, click the spam button, then click yes on the popup that asks if you want to block their email address<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:38)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that'll block all of their email addresses<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:53)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Keybindings help dealing with them quickly. But that only handles the current problem, not the recurring spam problem<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <tt>j</tt> to move to the next one, <tt>x</tt> to select it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm not sure that is the problem, but move your rules to the top<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you can select all of them per page<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So that no other rule can trigger first<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:50)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> instead of going one-by-one<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (just review all the ones marked that way before marking them as spam and blocking their emails)<br/>

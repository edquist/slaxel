<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(01:53:13)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Hey, I downgraded to keepalived-1.2.13-8.el7.x86_64<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(01:55:15)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Both failover to down gftp servers and failover to the other keepalived all worked. The latest build version failed to read the config at all. I was able to build the latest latest from GitHub from the devs. The problem is that it simple would start the IPv6 failover. ipvsadm would never show the IPv6 side. As soon as I downgraded, Voila<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(01:56:03)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> By latest latest I mean the one that actually would build on RHEL7 since the one you download from their page, even though the version is the same, will not build on RHEL7<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:05)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> So I may have spoken a bit too soon. If gridftp was telnet then things would work. Unfortunately though I have had it work on and off I cannot get keepalive to work in conjunction with gridftp.<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:54:34)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> It connects fine but the return is not working right. Though I may have screwed something up on my test box too...<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(18:49:49)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> @gattebury Which version of keepalived are you running?<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(18:54:53)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> @gattebury Nevermind, 1.2.24-2 :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(20:35:36)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> @tmartin <a href="https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/66c870aae79c2a0b02c46ae7bfdc05483a951d4c">https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/commit/66c870aae79c2a0b02c46ae7bfdc05483a951d4c</a> is the exact commit I built that we’re running for the record, don’t honestly remember what the diff between that and 1.2.24 tag was off the top of my head<br/>

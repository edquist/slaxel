<h3>Sun Mar 7, 2021 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> That's weird. I get those from time to time but I'm a workspace admin.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:20)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I have no idea if anyone DMs it or uses the /jira commands; we tried it for like 15 minutes before deciding it was too noisy and muting it.<br/>

<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:43)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Did anyone uninstall/disconnect it? Just to make sure there aren't unaccounted for apps tied to someone's admin account.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(20:01:34)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Good question. I will take a look when I get back from vacation.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-03-08 08:40:22)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> If I am reading the admin panel correctly, Jira was added in 2018.  The "Activity Log"'s last entry is Dec. 18 2020.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-03-08 08:40:46)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'm not sure anything happened.  I wonder if it just notifies new users?<br/>

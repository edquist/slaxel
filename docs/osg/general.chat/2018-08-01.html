It looks like I might've made too large an update for the repo-update script to complete successfully. I've tried updating twice, and it doesn't look like it's been accepted. The details file doesn't have the 'success' message either:<br/><pre><br/>[ouser.accre@hcc-oasis-login ~]$ cat /stage/oasis/accre/update.details <br/>Update initiated: Wed Aug  1 14:29:16 CDT 2018<br/>Update unix time: 1533151756<br/>Initiated by: ouser.accre<br/>With proxy  : subject= /DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=meloam/CN=692113/CN=Andrew Malone Melo/CN=509940729/CN=1089482642<br/>via ssh from: <a href="http://gw1230.accre.vanderbilt.edu">gw1230.accre.vanderbilt.edu</a>.

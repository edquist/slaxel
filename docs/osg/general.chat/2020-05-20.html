<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:25)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @tiradani Fermi doesn't run the central manager in kubernetes because of something with CCB?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:43)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> That is the main reason.  We run one half of the CMS Global Pool Collectors and CCBs.  The number of active TCP connections to those nodes required kernel and network tuning.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:25)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> and you'd need to make sure the pod landed on the host you tuned?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:31)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> and one with the service IP assigned to it.  It does no good to have a pod run on a different node when you then need to route the traffic internally through the SDN.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:50)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> once you pin the IP and the tuning, you may as well run it on a dedicated node.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:23)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> makes sense. Thanks!<br/>

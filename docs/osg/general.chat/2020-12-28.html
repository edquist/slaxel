<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Anyone (perhaps @dweitzel or @blin) available to provide Slurm tips for implementing the following policy?:<br/>the osg01 user jobs are guaranteed 5 of nodes (compute036 to compute040), not interruptible), exceeding that amount only as backfill (lower priority AND interruptible)<br/>(See <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66475">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66475</a> for reference and feel free to jump in with details for Frank, if you have them.)<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:40)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Not an FD user, so I can't comment on the details, but it sounds like a similar recipe to AMNH (OSG FD# 65968) would work.<br/>Create two new partitions:<br/>- osg with access to compute[036-040]<br/>- osg-preempt with access to the entire cluster, but a lower <tt>PriorityTier</tt> and <tt>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</tt><br/>

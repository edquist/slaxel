<h3>Wed Mar 25, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:07)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> The OSG home page has been updated with a new highlighted banner about our desire to help facilitate COVID-19 research. Whoever is watching <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>, keep an eye out for related tickets and feel free to raise priority of such requests immediately. Honestly, the ET would probably like to hear about any credible request.<br/>

<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:41)</span> <b>burt:</b></span> @cat: There was a question at the lab’s all-hands about “can we help donate computing to COVID-19 research”; the answer he gave was that we provide opportunistic cycles via OSG and will continue to do so.  I already know a few scientists reaching out to their friends in chemistry and biology, hopefully I can forward something on …<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:01)</span> <b>burt:</b></span> also along those lines, one of our cosmology folks just sent a link to this: <a href="https://crowdfightcovid19.org/">https://crowdfightcovid19.org/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:06)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Cool, thanks @burt!<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:48)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> You can always point people straight to the OSG home page, which has a special banner about COVID-19: &lt;<a href="https://opensciencegrid.org">https://opensciencegrid.org</a>&gt;.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(18:10:30)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> For those not in the CMS-ops world, the various italian computing centers (like INFN) are apparently dedicating 30-50% of their compute to covid research<br/>

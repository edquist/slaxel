<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @efajardo A JLab person is asking for an OSG Connect (Globus) ProjectName.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Thoughts? Context? If they’re not logging into the JLab submit server via Globus accounts, then we won’t be keeping track of which users are supposed to be in which project. They can add ProjectName to their submit files, but I don’t think there’s any validation on the JLab server like there is on OSG Connect servers? @cbrown58 is asking after seeing the Project request come through.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(18:10:49)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Indeed this is all truth<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(18:11:23)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> and right now we cannot validate the project name until we package and install the OSG Connect tech that allows for that verification.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:03:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <tt>install the OSG Connect tech that allows for that verification</tt> ? Is that in the works?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(23:11:30)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> not that i am aware of :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(23:13:10)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> as i recall we are just using a wrapper around condor_submit, which I think is fine to use but I would really advise against any other site using it. wrapping condor_submit is generally a bad time<br/>

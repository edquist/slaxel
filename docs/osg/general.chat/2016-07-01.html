<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:02)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @lincoln: working on a plugin that would allow you to keep your CVMFS cache in Ceph in addition to the worker node. Would you guys be interested in stuff like this?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:30)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> We don't mount Ceph locally on the nodes. I'm not sure what the advantage is and context. Stashcache or software or..?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:33)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Well - this would use librados directly<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> The idea is that a shared storage is going to be better than squids once you have enough objects in cache<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:09)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Why not use radosgw? Then you only need to populate the cache you use normal HTTP_PROXY for accessing the data locally. No changes needed on the client<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:37)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> (also, warning phone-like typing)<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:02)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Either way ditching squid is a great idea. would recommend.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:39)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> OK I guess you'd have to mess around with civetweb or Apache something in that case actually.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:36)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Still it seems like having a radosgw-based generic HTTP caching proxy would be handy in a general case. <br/>

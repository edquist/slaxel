<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(18:48:51)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> I've been working on this about a day but: All of the Rucio documentation I have access to is about a year, sometimes more, out of date<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(18:51:59)</span> <b>manglano:</b></span> If anyone knows how to go from the Docker container to <tt>userpass</tt> authentication for the <tt>[client]</tt> field in rucio.cfg, please contact me directly. Judith is on vacation and the Rucio community appears to have removed a lot of code without updating the documentation so it's effectively referring to software which no longer exists...Neither does the Docker repo contain the 1.14.9 image or the removed portions<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:24:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> it’s me again. I have a user who is getting a “cannot write” error:<br/><pre>NotWritableError: The current user does not have write permissions to a required path.<br/>  path: /sge-batch/3607573.1.lnxfarm/glide_ZiH94I/execute/dir_68032/.conda/pkgs/urls.txt</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:25:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’ve double checked — the path listed is the same as the job’s <tt>$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR</tt> and that .conda folder would have been created by the user(’s) executable…so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t be writable?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:27:50)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> let me know which channel I should direct this to…it’s a user from CHTC (GLOW VO) but running on what I think is the Colorado site.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:29:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Maybe they are inside a container and the <tt>$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR</tt> is set wrong?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:30:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Can you dump <tt>env</tt> - that should tell us<br/>

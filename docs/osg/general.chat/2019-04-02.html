<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> hey all, and maybe @sesons, @rwg. Looks like there are some aging Security and Operations group tix still unassigned to an agent. Part of the problem with Security may be that there aren’t any Security group members with full agent status?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ah, operations, that's me.  I'm triage this week.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> i looked earlier today, didn't seem bad.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:09)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I don't see any ops tickets unassigned.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:45)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> I’m not reliably available in slack - just tried to help out in a pinch today<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:19)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> is there something specific I can help with?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:25:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, there's a bunch of glideinwms tickets.  I wonder what to do with those.  Marian is at Cern, Jeff is off...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:26:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Just looked at ops instructions, say to leave glideinwms tickets unassigned.<br/>

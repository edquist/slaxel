<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(00:15:07)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> @gattebury Ok I solved the issue with 1.3.2 and I feel that it is safe to have folks use that version, at least from the perspective that if it is built correctly, correctly being a system with the lbnl library available, then it will properly create the IPVS table entries for IPv6.<br/><br/>However...that still does not have my IPv6 working properly. Notably the passive data connection simply does not connect to the gridftp server. The control connection works fine, but the data connection just tries to connect to the LVS router, and does not get passed to the gridftp server.<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(01:16:31)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> It seems to me that there should be some fwmarking going on to keep this straight no?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(06:54:46)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Do you have the /etc/gridftp.d/data_interface.conf file set up with a “data_interface &lt;fqdn&gt;” line, and the /etc/gridftp-hdfs/gridftp.conf with a “data_interface &lt;global v6 address&gt;” line on your gridftp server? Honestly not sure both are needed these days — certainly won’t hurt. That’s the only way the grifdtp server knows to say “no no no, data path goes from this interface address"<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(06:56:06)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> if the initial data channel response from the client upstream isn’t going to your real server, then I imagine it didn’t even rewrite the control channel packets correctly either, which again might be due to the above<br/>

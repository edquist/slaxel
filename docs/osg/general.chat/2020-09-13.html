<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:35)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> Hey, I have a condor-related question.<br/>Do I ask it here, or is there a dedicated channel?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:08)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> Actually the condor questions are two, not one :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:38)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I don’t think there’s a dedicated channel. Ask away!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:14)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> OK, First question is this:<br/>In the  <tt>/var/condor/condor_config.local</tt> files on one of our clusters we have the following ranking expression:<br/><pre>RANK = (Owner == "cmspilot") + (Owner == "uscmslcl") + ((Owner == "lcgadmin") * 1000) + ((Owner == "cmslocal") * 100 )</pre><br/>which more or less adequately ranks the external users submitting from the GRID through the CE, as they get mapped to the corresponding Owners.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:08)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> But we have no expression for the local users. As a result, their jobs frequently get evicted by remote jobs.<br/>Can I use some sort of generic/collective name for the local users, instead of listing them all on the RANK line?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:52)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> In other words, how do I express in condor-speak a group of users?<br/>

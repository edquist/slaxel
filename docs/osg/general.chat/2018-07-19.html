<span style="color: #dc7dbb"><span style="font-size: small">(08:24:54)</span> <b>carsten.aulbert:</b></span> @dwd - after having  a simple two stage squid set-up working (i.e. local CVMFS client talks to squidB which in turn can only talk upstream to squidA which then can talk to CVMFS stratum1), my question is if I should simply have 30 stand-alone squids who will be talked to by clients and talk to two parents or if I should put these "lower tiers" into a larger (multicast) sibling cloud?<br/>

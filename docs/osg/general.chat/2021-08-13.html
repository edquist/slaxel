<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Calling @rynge @bbockelm @blin, given recent conversations. Overall pool goodput has been lowish for a week, across most users. I know Mats mentioned site issues at Utah and Brian. I’m seeing users with otherwise successful jobs experience failures ONLY on specific sites . E.g.<br/><pre>[lmichael@login04 ~]$ condor_q npcooley -af ClusterId MATCH_EXP_JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName | sort | uniq -c<br/>    <a href="tel:16814394561">168 14394561</a> SU-ITS-CE2<br/>      9 14395923 SLATE_US_UUTAH_NOTCHPEAK</pre><br/>In the above case, user npcooley has portions of his jobs that go on hold when they exit non-zero. Everything other than the below succeeded. The errors are a bit different every time (<tt>kill</tt> but noted for a different line in his code each time; he’s requesting plenty of memory/disk).<br/><br/>What are we doing short-term and long-term? This particular user depends on a singularity container, as do very many others. Why are we continuing to allow jobs to match to Utah? How do we figure out what’s going on with SU?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I have worked on Utah, and we no longer allow images from CVMFS<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:27)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm not 100% sure this will help, but it might<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> The 9 jobs were submitted yesterday at 3pm CT. Was the fix implemented before then? If so, then something’s still now working.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:48)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> What about SU? How can we learn about these instability issues sooner? Where can we look?<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:45)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> SU as in Syracuse? ping Eric?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> If you have details on what nodes the jobs ran at, timestamps and so on, I might be able to find the glidein logs and see what went wrong<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:53:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Re Utah - those jobs were probably pre-fix<br/>

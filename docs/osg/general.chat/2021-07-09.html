<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:03)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Whenever to someone about the values of distributed computing, I inevitably get questions about how such network remains secure. Comments about encrypted daemon&lt;-&gt;daemon communication or containerized environments have little effect in countering their skepticism. Are there any other best-practices worth mentioning to convince folks that dHTC isn't a fools-errand security wise?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Arguing whether something is "secure" is meaningless unless you're claiming "there is no such thing as a secure system".  The question is what risk you're taking on and what are you willing to accept.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:19)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> "Secure against whom?" Is a good response too<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Risk is probability times impact.  In our experience, the probability of a targeted attack on a worker node is extremely low and the impact is relatively modest (particularly for open science).  The much larger risk is a shared login host that many people connect to from laptops of dubious origin containing their credentials and identities.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:55)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> you have to trust the people with root access to the machines.  beyond that, it's merely a zero-trust system, which is good security practice anyway.  I agree that the biggest security risk is login hosts, which all computing clusters have<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:15:39)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Depending on what exactly your threat model is, I'd say the risk of the distributed component is epsilon more than a login host (and the leading order term is the user's email client :wink: )<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:14)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> I do reply that many of the problems occur on all systems with remote login that trust users not to be dicks and run awful/malicious code.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:21)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Just frustrating that someone having the machines spatially separated and having the admins not all paid by the same employer makes such a dramatic difference in some peoples minds.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(17:25:10)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> I am not a security expert or system administrator so am not really able to have a confident back &amp; forth on this subject with authority. And I don't normally have an expert on hand when I do get these questions. Hence my original query.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(23:13:08)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I think that "questions about how such network remains secure" is a good opportunity to ask for a clarification of what they mean. Then based on the concerns, you can evolve from there<br/>

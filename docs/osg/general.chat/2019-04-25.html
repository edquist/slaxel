<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:25)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> FWIW - Now that we're ~ a month out from our old CILogon certs from expiring, I'm going through the hoops to get IGTF certs from <a href="http://digicert-grid.com/">http://digicert-grid.com/</a> since Vanderbilt doesn't have an InCommon subscription. Does anyone know of a good way to inspect a cert and see if it would pass the osg-provided CA bundle?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the simplest way is probably just getting a cert and comparing its issuer vs <a href="https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/cadist/">https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/cadist/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> or instead of the issuer, getting the entire cert chain<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:37)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @andrew.melo - I would do <tt>openssl x509 -in /.../hostcert.pem -noout -issuer_hash</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:05)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Was there xrootd 4.9.1-1 release announcement? I did not see it.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:02)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> the release announcement for the software itself is <a href="http://xrootd.org/2019/04/05/announcement_4_9_1.html;">http://xrootd.org/2019/04/05/announcement_4_9_1.html;</a> we're putting it in the OSG release 3.4.28 that is going out today, and it will be in the release announcement for that.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:19)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I see. Thanks Mat! Nebraska had it already, so I thought OSG version 4.9.1-1 was released long ago.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nebraska's just been running it out of osg-testing<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:52)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Got it! Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:56)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @bockjoo - if you have time to upgrade a host to 4.9.1 and have macaroons / third-party-copy enabled, let me know.<br/>

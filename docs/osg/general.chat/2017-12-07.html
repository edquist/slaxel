<h3>Thu Dec 7, 2017 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:49)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hey, OSG folks - there seems to be a high-quality phishing attack going out to at least some OSG folks this morning by email. Subject line is “notice of data breach”, and it looks quite convincing. The GOC is aware of it, says it is bogus, and is investigating actively.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:11)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ugh, I *just* saw that it is a security exercise.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:51)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yeah, and <a href="http://gridsecurity.info">gridsecurity.info</a> page is a pretty good phishing attempt.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:23)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> I just want to say that you guys warm my :heart:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:11)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ah, I didn’t actually follow the link.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:37)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Only three people followed the link, only one attempted to submit the form.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:41)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Also, @sesons they are talking about DDoSing your gridsecurity site over in the #osg-support room… (^_^)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I didn't follow the link.  I went independent.  #osg-support people went even further.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:00)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> we just want to make sure your infrastructure is scalable<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:06)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> ROFL<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:30)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @lincoln sounds like you are also volunteering to comb the logs for legitimate accesses… (^_^)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:46)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> please be kind...we didn't have a convenient place to host that so I threw it up on the server for my mom's quilting site :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:56)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> LOL<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:00)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Poor mom.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:02)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> i was hoping you are capturing the usernames/passwords so i can use it as a key/value storage system<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:26)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> No, the form doesn't really submit any data, I'm just counting clicks.<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:27)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> did the submission contain real stuff or were they saying, "YOU ARE FAKE!"<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:30)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> ah<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:43)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> I would probably put something mean into the blanks.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:52)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> We stopped counting about 10 minutes ago, so if anyone wants to click it now just to see, you won't add to the stats.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:57)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:05)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> all of my efforts wasted<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:19)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Wow, @sesons, you have interesting ideas about when OSG staff starting working each morning…<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:46)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> That was Zalak's interpretation of my directive "try to get at least some people before they've had their coffee" :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:52)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I would say that less than half of the OSG Software and Release team is functional yet.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thursdays are workdays?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:08)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> But to be fair, it didn't seem worth continuing after Sarah warned everyone.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:17)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> ROTFL<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:05)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> See, at IU, we are routinely phished by our CIO, so we're all very paranoid about all of this.<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:19)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> So people immediately freaked out inside our team.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:36)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> Yep.<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:53)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> and I just had to sit there quietly<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:04)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> :smiling_imp:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:09)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I think that this is a first for me — I cannot recall an intention phishing test before.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:50)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @cat Then you get double credit -- MOST people don't stop falling for them until after an exercise or three, unless they are already paranoid security people by trade.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:00)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @sesons will you be sharing (summary) results within OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:18)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @sesons I have a mother…<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:22)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @cat Yes, it will be in my AC report next week. :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:28)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Cool.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> at hepix a few years ago they did a phishing test promising free beer if they clicked the link<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there were a lot of clicks<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:04)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> was there beer?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the beer was a lie<br/>
<span style="color: #A82F2F"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:13)</span> <b>gfarr:</b></span> rude<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> or was it like, if you clicked on the link you had to buy the pitcher?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> lol that would've been doubly evil<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:33)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @zalak I didn't see a warning announcement from Sarah<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:15)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> She was warning operations internally initially as she was submitting her own ticket.<br/>
<span style="color: #e0a729"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:45)</span> <b>kylegross:</b></span> there wasn't an OSG-wide announcement yet.<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:01)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Sorry, I wan't clear enough in my email. She also had created a GOC ticket (<a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/35581">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/35581</a>) and added the security team in that.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:30:48)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> ah ok<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:04)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> Are there plans in the future to resume training and drills for problems we’ve seen like misbehaving users and privilege escalation and so on?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:37)</span> <b>sesons:</b></span> @elizabethprout yes. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:57)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> I am having a heck of a time in the last week trying to keep my CVMFS mounts working right on my RHEL6 based boxes. They keep checking out and stopping jobs. I am trying to get my squid servers fully updated now, but is there anything that changed?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there was a new version in the last release<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dwd have you heard anything about cvmfs and el6?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:42)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> No I haven’t heard any problems<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:00)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> I think I found the issue, 20GB is not enough, I had only updated my RHEL7 boxes but the RHEL6 side was fine so I did not increase that to 40GB. I am doing that now, hopefully that will clear the issue./<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:42)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> What exactly do you mean by ‘checking out and stopping jobs’?<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:08)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> The way to tell whether or not the cache is big enough is to find out how often cache cleanups happen<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:35)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> It should never stop jobs completely<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:33)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> You can inquire about the number of cleanups in the last 24 hours with ‘attr -qg ncleanup24 /cvmfs/repo.name’ were repo.name is any mounted repo.<br/>

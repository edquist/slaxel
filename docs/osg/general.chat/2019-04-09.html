<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:27)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Hi Mat<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:54)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> @lmichael @christinalk we have a little relic in the docs  <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634383-contacting-the-osg">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634383-contacting-the-osg</a> : a phone support channel (which I discovered still works): calling <a href="tel:855-250-4510">855-250-4510</a> and leaving a voicemail generates a ticket with audio clip (try it!).   (We were experimenting with phone support for a while.)   If you don’t want this Brian L can speak with FD support to have it disabled.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ve told @blin we don’t want it. @christinalk and @cbrown58, can you look into removing references to the phone number/call option<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:14)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> @lmichael I’ve removed it from the page referenced above.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks!<br/>

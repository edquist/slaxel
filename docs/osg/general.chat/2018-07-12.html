<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:05)</span> <b>mick_sbgrid:</b></span> this might be a dumb question! Most people requesting x509 certs from the SBGrid VO are members of the North American Structural Biology Community. Our Instructions at <a href="https://portal.sbgrid.org/d/certificate/steps/">https://portal.sbgrid.org/d/certificate/steps/</a> tell members to register with the OSG. I'm assuming with the recent changes that we can no longer issue x509 certs to individuals?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:16)</span> <b>mick_sbgrid:</b></span> Most people requesting certs for use with WeNMR at:  <a href="https://www.wenmr.eu/">https://www.wenmr.eu/</a> It doesn't look like they have a registration system at the moment.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if by "we" you mean the OSG, yea, we don't issue certs at all anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if the instution's that your users are a part of are listed at <a href="http://cilogon.org">cilogon.org</a>, that's the recommendation<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (<a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/security/user-certs/#getting-a-user-certificate">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/security/user-certs/#getting-a-user-certificate</a>)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:29)</span> <b>mick_sbgrid:</b></span> I suppose I mean the OSG as we were a VO! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:34)</span> <b>mick_sbgrid:</b></span> Our users are Structural Biologists in North America, so no single institution.<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:55)</span> <b>mick_sbgrid:</b></span> I guess I"m unclear on the VO changes etc. When was this all discussed and decided?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> about a year and a half ago<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> starting with discussions about software retirements in osg 3.3<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/voms-admin-retire/">https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/voms-admin-retire/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> though the OSG CA had to be retired because of service migrations: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/service-migrations-spring-2018/">https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/service-migrations-spring-2018/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so even if there isn't a single institution for them, they can most likely use their home institution's credentials to get a cert from <a href="http://cilogon.org">cilogon.org</a><br/>

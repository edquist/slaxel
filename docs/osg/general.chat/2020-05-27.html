<h3>Wed May 27, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:03)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have someone trying to connect to the OSG from the Jefferson Lab. Theyâ€™ve been unsuccessful in getting access through the JLab access point. Should I go ahead and give them access on OSG Connect as a stopgap, or can someone point me at a contact who can get them going at JLab?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tbritton is this something for you? ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:33)</span> <b>tbritton:</b></span> @blin probably.  Please have them send me an email <a href="mailto:tbritton@jlab.org">tbritton@jlab.org</a> or forward me the request<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:18:10)</span> <b>tbritton:</b></span> whoever it is I can probably get them set up, no need for osg connect :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:05)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Thanks @tbritton! I told them to email you.<br/>

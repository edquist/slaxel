<h3>Tue May 12, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:04:24)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Can we get a comprehensive view of usage across submit points that submit to the OSG (“Open Science”) pool, to see which of it comes from each campus? (For annual report)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:19:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, I’m not really looking for usage by submit point. I’m looking for usage by campus and by project, but many that we know should be there (Duke, AMNH *not* via OSG Connecdt, etc.) seem to be missing in the OSG Project Accounting page (that I linked to) or anywhere else. The old “OSG Connect - All Usage” page (I think) previously captured the entire OS Pool, but can we get a new page for that? And can we get breakdown by campus and by projects?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:20:31)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Is it terribly difficult to get usage by submit point (and have each submit point listed by its associated campus or multi-institutional project)?<br/>

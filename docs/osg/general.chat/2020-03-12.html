<h3>Thu Mar 12, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jletts are we talking about ENMR?<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:43)</span> <b>jletts:</b></span> Yes<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:40)</span> <b>jletts:</b></span> enmr opened a ticket wanting a change in cvmfs, if I recall correctly. We haven’t had to do something like this in maybe a decade.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:14)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> question about software - what is the state of mathematica support on OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:25)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> since it's a licensed product it probably doesn't fly<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @rwg #osg-connect should know the answer to that<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:12)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> running mathematica kernels isn't too hard (at least it wasn't 7 or 8 years ago..) but the software needs to check into a license server<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:31)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> And, as we found out, that license server can't be virtualized<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:01)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Well, it can be, but if you migrate to another hypervisor, you're in for a surprise<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Licensed software is basically impossible, unless the license allows the user to manage their own license server/tokens, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:14)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Recently, we had to remove a software module or two because we realized that, even though the license is open to anyone in academia, the developers expect that EACH user downloads their own copy and doesn’t share with others. Having the software in OSG (with modules in CVMFS) was pretty close to making the software ‘public’.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:48)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> those kind of silly licenses sound basically unenforceable :slightly_smiling_face: but alas..<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:01:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Unenforcable? Yes. Auditable? Also yes :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:50)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> as I recall Douglas Crockford created a 'this software must not be used for evil' license for JSON<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:06)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> IBM was able to get an exemption, presumably to use JSON for evil.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> where's the laughing on the outside but dying on the inside emoji?<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:28)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I think it’s this one:sweat_smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> lol<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah that's the one<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:07)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Okay, follow up re: the ENMR person. THey want to know “which are the OSG sites that currently support this VO”<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> how are they submitting jobs? do they have their own VO frontend or are they going through the OSG VO?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:02)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have no idea<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:43)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> that may be one of the things this person wants to know as well. Is there a place we track VO specific info? is that place a person’s brain?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm, they do have a default user mapping for sites, so if sites create the account, they should be able to submit there<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> they should probably contact the people listed here: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/ENMR.yaml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/virtual-organizations/ENMR.yaml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hopefully it's up to date =/<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:20)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Marco Verlato is the person who has been emailing me. :upside_down_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> lolllll<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> This feels very “who’s on first”, haha.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> well, i just looked at the central collector where all OSG sites advertise to and none of them say they support the ENMR VO<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think we need to find out more about how he's submitting jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is there a ticket? software should probably be talking to him directly<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I would be happy to let you take this off my hands. :wink:<br/>

<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:26)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> So I am noticing the the gridftp servers on my new LVS mapped system are hanging around for a long time. Is there a way to get these gridftp servers to close up after the transfer is done in a more timely manner?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:59:09)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Many (most?) of the bugs within globus-gridftp-server that manifest like that have been squashed over the years, but I can at least confirm we still see cases at Nebraska where processes get stuck and linger indefinitely as well<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:07)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Seems to happen infrequently enough for us now that I’ve not spent any real effort trying to find the remaining bugs — cronjob to nuke old (12+ hour old) processes is our current “hammer” for the problem<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:38)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> The ideal solution of course would be for the bugs to be found and eliminated :confused:<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:25)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> The problem is that I every time I try to swap to these servers, despite them working well for testing the seem to want to consume all their memory and crash<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:25)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Just stopped them again since for some reason the SAM tests do not like them either, and they were pushing 700+ gridftp server processes<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:53)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Do you guys have any special settings at UNL to keep these servers from getting out of control?<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:14)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Any special settings in /etc/sysconfig/ ?<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(18:50:05)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> Hmm maybe it is a setting in lvs<br/>
<span style="color: #b14cbc"><span style="font-size: small">(18:50:11)</span> <b>tmartin:</b></span> or some side effect of lvs<br/>

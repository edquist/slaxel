<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:46)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Anyone else noticing that your replies in FreshDesk (intended for the requestor) are not automatically filling in the requestor’s email address as the recipient? On multiple tickets, now, I’m seeing that the recipients (To:) field is empty when I click to reply (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:39:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> nvm … I think I was confusing the forward and reply options … maybe the interface slightly changed, or I’m just waking up from a long turkey coma<br/>

<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:03:54)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> Does anybody know of a major occurrence in the xrootd and storage related fabric of OSG/CMS US T1/T2s on March 18, 10:10 am - 12pm Central time? Like a site rebooting all xrootd servers or FNAL restarting dcache?<br/>I'm investigating a drop of about 70,000 connections from 11 xcache machines at UCSD -- connections that should have been closed but for some reason remained opened (over a period of a month) and then suddenly got clsoed at this interval :)<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(19:08:29)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Maybe this related:<br/><pre>Dear All,<br/>   we now believe we understand the xrootd daylight-savings<br/>issue a bit more. Can all sites that had a daylight-savings<br/>change last week please restart the xrootd services at their<br/>sites (if it was not yet restarted since)? This only applies to<br/>native xrootd services, not dCache, etc.<br/>   (Internal time handling is off by an hour until a restart.)<br/>   Thanks,<br/>            cheers,  Stephan</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(19:09:03)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> feel like that's the wrong date/time for that<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:14:35)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> yess, but maybe some site decided to do the reboot at that time<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:14:41)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> thank you!<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(19:15:51)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Considering the T2s are in the ... 10k-ish range of cores, I'd be surprised if a single site rebooting could cause 70k connections to drop<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:17:18)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> Those were not active connections ... those were floating sockets collected over about a month<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:17:52)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> Stepan sent this mail on March 18, 3pm central ... so maybe they rebooted xrootd frontends to dcache that morning :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:18:03)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> FNAL rebooting could explain it<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(19:18:19)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Perhaps :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(19:18:47)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> hey, i'm grabbing onto straws here ;)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(19:24:10)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> The 18th is a thurs .. and I kinda feel like (?????) I remember the redirectors being bounced<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(20:31:32)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> thanks, good to know!<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(20:48:16)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I can't say what with any confidence, but I kinda remember a mail coming by about it<br/>

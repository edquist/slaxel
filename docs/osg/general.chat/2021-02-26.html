<h3>Fri Feb 26, 2021 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> As we prepare for the All Hands Meeting (#all-hands), we’re also reorganizing some other channels that you might want to check out.<br/><br/>For example, the former #osg-connect (where operational issues and specific OSG users are discussed ‘internally’) has been made private, and some members removed. If you were removed or were never a member and think you still need access (especially OSG staff, OSG Council, ET, etc.), just let us know.<br/><br/>So, we have also created #osg-user-community. Please join us there to engage with OSG staff and users (everywhere) on compute execution strategies, issues, and requests for help!<br/>

<h3>Wed Feb 5, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:52)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Hi OSG Folks, I came across osg directory on our hadoop instance at cit_cms_t2, where all files are pretty old (overall about ~1.5TB) and not sure if they are still needed/used. Is this still needed or everything there can be wiped out?<br/>

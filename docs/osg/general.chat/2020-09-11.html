<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:20)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Is a grid certificate from OSG still required for ILDG? And if so, who handles these requests?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ILDG?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:18)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> <a href="https://www.usqcd.org/ildg/">https://www.usqcd.org/ildg/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:50)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Under the second(?) heading it says:<br/><pre>Obtain a personal grid certificate from the Open Science Grid. </pre><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:16)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I’m not entirely convinced the individual asking about it is actually associated with this project vs just trying to get access. But I was curious if the directions referenced here are defunct or not.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:16)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> I think that's outdated- OSG doesn't issue certs these days.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:25)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I thought as much. Thanks Lincoln.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:05)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cbrown58 I saw that ticket and was very confused.  What is ILDG? How do they use/integrate with OSG? What should we do with an ILDG-associated user who is non-US? Thoughts? @paschos, or anyone else with prior history/context knowledge?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if it's any indication of timeline, OSG hasn't required end users to have personal certificates for nearly 5 years<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:04)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> checking on above --- but it seems that this just expired documentation<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> sure, but there’s someone claiming to be ILDG who requested an OSG Connect account. He’s non-US, so should he have access to OSG some other way? (that wouldn’t require a certificate, of course)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:11)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> ok -- responding to email. Separate from the user request, we will need to reach out ILDG to update their documentation. An eligible user can obtain a cert from cilogon and then use that to join the ILDG VO.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Being that their software docs include ScientificLinux 5.4 and Fedora 6 as recent supported versions....<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:44)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> that's my understanding of this<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:41)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> ok ... well I can reach out to ILDG for them to refresh their docs... unless someone else wants to take this<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @paschos we don't have an ILDG VO so I think the question is, was ILDG perhaps affiliated with OSG in some other way?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:46)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i don't know --- but joining their VO requires visiting DESY--- with instructions here:<br/><a href="https://hpc.desy.de/ldg/userdoc/new_user/certificates/">https://hpc.desy.de/ldg/userdoc/new_user/certificates/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:02)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> @bbockelm good taste doesn't go out of style? :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:20)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> Following their process access to USQCD is on local resources at BNL, FNAL and JLAB. I can't find an OSG connection anywhere on the usqcd site... besides just getting certs<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:05)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ticket 27089 “New OASIS repository for <a href="http://sphenix.sdcc.bnl.gov">sphenix.sdcc.bnl.gov</a>”. To @paschos?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> got a link?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/27089">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/27089</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, in FreshDesk, the ticket-shaped icon in the left menu is for “New tickets”, and shows all new tickets not assigned to an agent, including tickets with and without an automatic group assignment:<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> It’s a great place for ticket watchers to look for un-grouped tickets that may be relevant for their group AND for tickets already assigned to their group. The OSG Connect team doesn’t have to be the only ones watching that page. It’s a very useful page.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> &gt; FYI, in FreshDesk, the ticket-shaped icon in the left menu is for “New tickets”,<br/>is that true? iirc, it brings you to the filter that you were last using<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think this is the preferred filter to use: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/5000322056">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/5000322056</a><br/>groups don't need to be worrying about unassigned tickets belonging to other groups<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Okay, then. The Question-Mark icon takes you to the Dashboard, where you can click on the “Unassigned” category.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Either way, it’s: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> And any ticket watcher from any group can claim things for their group, or assign to other groups when the group assignment is obvious to them.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah but that looks at all tickets without an agent assigned<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if a ticket doesn't have an agent assigned but has a group assigned, other groups shouldn't be messing with those tickets<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> My point is that it’s even better than looking JUST at unassigned tickets for your group, because you can see other tix that might be relevant for your group AND help assign tix to relevant groups. It’s never that many tickets to look at.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, so you just want to look at tickets with an unassigned group<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> That’s not really my point.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we should talk about this in person because i think we're talking past each other<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> The OSG Connect team watches that page, b/c someone decided it should be our sole responsibility to assign tickets to groups when they don’t get an auto-assignment. But the un-grouped tix rarely make sense for the OSG Connect team to take, and we usually have to ask around to find out the ‘right’ assignment, which is frequently more obvious to someone in tech/software/etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i've got a few minutes to chat on the phone if you're free now<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:04)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Plus, there are times when it’s clear that a specific group hasn’t been picking up tix, and that may be because the watcher for that group is out sick, or just away from their desk all day (fires, etc.).<br/>It would probably be more efficient for all ticket watchers to watch the “unassigned” page. You get (1) your group’s tickets (2) un-grouped tickets that may/may not be relevant to your group, but that you can help route better than the OSG Connect team, and (3) the ability see when another group may be falling way behind, and bring that to someone’s attention.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:28)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> gtg to a call<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> alright, well i'm meeting free this afternoon if you've got 10-15 min in there somewhere<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ll be in your building around lunchtime<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:40)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> @lmichael I am not sure how to set this up. happy to take a look<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @paschos i think it's actually an Ops activity<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you actively support sPhenix?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:50)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i am not... but if this is a collaboration/experiment engagment i would like to see if there is anything i can help with<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:10)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i'm not sure if that's necessary. It's a BNL-based experiment<br/>

<h3>Thu Dec 10, 2015 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(00:40:30)</span> <b>dgc:</b></span> @bbockelm @scotwk check with suchandra or lincoln — our condor_submit wrapper script (python) parses the submit file into a Job instance. Job is a list subclass (to preserve order) that you can assign into like a dict to add/alter ads. It has methods to return the submit file as a multiline string, to submit using condor_submit, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(00:41:15)</span> <b>dgc:</b></span> Since I’m no longer with uchicago or osg you’ll need suchandra or lincoln to give access.<br/>

<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:06)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> @bbockelm: @dweitzel :<br/><br/>&gt; Since Scot is a battle-hardened professional, it might be worth it to try having the IU setup of BOSCO be a prototype HTCondor-CE-BOSCO.<br/><br/>Sorry to be late to the game on this - I haven't been on slack in a bit.  I got Bosco working to submit to my local cluster (Karst), but as soon as I did my condor stopped flocking properly to OSG.  I didn't have a chance to debug that yet, but that's next on my plate.<br/>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:45)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> I'll be traveling a bit next week so time might be sparse, but if not next week, I'll definitely have time the week after.  I'll ping Derek on here.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:48)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> user support folks: at the last meeting I attended, you had briefly mentioned you might want some help during the all hands meeting, so I wanted to let you know who among our group is going. It should be Kyle, Rob and Scott. I will not be attending this year<br/>

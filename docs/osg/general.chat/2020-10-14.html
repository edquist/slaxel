<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yeah, a Galaxy server runs all tasks as the ‘galaxy’ user, and the fact that users of the server can upload their own code means they could sabotage each other and other critical functions carried out by the ‘galaxy’ user. Unless that changed, it might be VERY difficult to support. @bbockelm may have thoughts or want to discuss more.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> It works in the context of a single research group (where everyone trusts each other, impact is limited to within the group, and consequences are high), but DiscoverIT briefly tried running separate instances per group (with Discovery cluster as back-end) before realizing it went completely unused.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:16)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, the model of use that William sent me was for a modified version of Galaxy called “pulsar” which is currently in use at TACC and distributing jobs across other XSEDE resources<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:48)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> which makes me think at least SOME of those issues have been addressed or it wouldn’t be in use in that way<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ah!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> the original galaxy docs definitely said “you need a shared filesystem” and I was like…uh…that’s not going to work.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:41:50)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> it sounds like pulsar addresses that issue, but I still don’t know a lot about it.  if I wanted to loop together relevant people, who should be included?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:45:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @bbockelm first<br/>

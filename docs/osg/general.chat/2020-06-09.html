<h3>Tue Jun 9, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:12)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ do I just create the ticket in Freshdesk? And who does it get assigned to  - software or operations?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that should go to operations<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:46:04)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> this ticket from AMNH got routed to OSG Connect support but I think it’s more likely a hosted CE problem. Can someone confirm? <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65124">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65124</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:13:05)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It's not a hosted-ce problem.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:13:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It looks like a hosted submit host that should be flocking to the OSG.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(22:56:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> non-hosted submit host<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(22:57:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Who/what area can help them with submit host config? They’re better-analyze makes it look like they’re not accessing the right slots. Cert issue? Something else? (Look at the ticket.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(22:58:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> This should be URGENT, btw. Way more than a CE. There’s a user actively trying to scale up on that submit host.<br/>

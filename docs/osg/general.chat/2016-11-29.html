<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:15)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> does anyone know if HTCondor can use subject alternative names w/ GSI auth?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:20)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @lincoln 'maybe'.  Depends on what you are doing.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:59)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I recall HTCondor implement its own host checking, so the answer there is probably not.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:59)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Is the error message along these lines:<br/><pre><br/>We are trying to connect to a daemon with certificate DN (%s), but the host name in the certificate does not match any DNS name associated with the host to which we are connecting (host name is '%s', IP is '%s', Condor connection address is '%s').  Check that DNS is correctly configured.  If the certificate is for a DNS alias, configure HOST_ALIAS in the daemon's configuration.  If you wish to use a daemon certificate that does not match the daemon's host name, make GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK_CERT_REGEX match the DN, or disable all host name checks by setting GSI_SKIP_HOST_CHECK=true or by defining GSI_DAEMON_NAME.\n<br/></pre><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> because that code definitely does _not_ look at alt names.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (that woudl be a relatively small fix though)<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(16:52:03)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> i haven't actually tried it yet, i kinda wanted to make a pool of schedds that i only have to maintain one DN for in my central manager<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Where should I send requests for help setting up a VO? (at least, as stated by the person who contacted us)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/8008">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/8008</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:21)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @lmichael it doesn't sound like it's just setting up their own VO, they want to set up their own grid altogether<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think we should have a phone call with them to understand the specifics of what they want<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> - do they just want to tie their resources together to effectively create their own pool?<br/>- how many sites and users?<br/>- can we just set them up in the OSG VO with special projects for their site a la cancer computer?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> - can they really not run OSG jobs?<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:50:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @dweitzel this seems to be in your wheelhouse of expertise(s), but let me know how I can assist with this question following this week’s workshop: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66790">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66790</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yup, I can take that.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Hasan's been hitting up condor-users with similar questions<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah. Anything we can do to make sure the answers he receives are consistent?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I see no one has answered on the HTCondor side?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:53)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> (email was just this morning)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> jaime's had some back and forth with him over the past month<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ah, yes, I was CC'd on that thread as well.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> at this point i'm confused as to why he's reaching out to the OSG -- it'd be helpful to know who he is/what he's trying to achieve<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:00)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> he attended the dHTC workshop<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh, should we be trying to onboard him onto OSG Connect then? having him use Bosco doesn't seem like the right direction<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:54)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> i think he's just curious to better understand what makes HTCondor, Slurm, and BOSCO different<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:04:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah, makes sense<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I think he’s already using OSG Connect, based upon the thread I linked above.<br/>

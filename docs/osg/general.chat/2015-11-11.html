<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(19:14:29)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> I'll be working with @rquick on setting up a new submit node at IU.  It's nice to be back in the fold.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:17:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hi Scot. I'm usually in <#C03MW0RTU><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:17:41)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Or you can direct message<br/>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(19:23:50)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> I was about to tell you guys that I was following the OSG Client installation for OSG 3.3 and it didn't work (because there is no osg-client package), but it looks like @efajardo already updated the docs since then.  That was quick!<br/>

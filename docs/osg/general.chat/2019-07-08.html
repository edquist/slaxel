<h3>Mon Jul 8, 2019 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:27)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <b>@here</b> last week someone approved an osg connect account request (joining the “osg” group in globus) for Riyad Hakim outside of our usual onboarding workflow - can whoever did this please let me know who they are? thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:42)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I need to know if this was an error (and we should continue on w/ our usual onboarding) or if someone else is taking responsibility for this person.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> you usually do it from same login node? if so auth.log or audit.log would perhaps help to backtrace who did it? (surely simplest would be raise the hand :))<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:01)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I usually approve from the web interface - but if there’s a record on the log in node, that would work too!<br/>

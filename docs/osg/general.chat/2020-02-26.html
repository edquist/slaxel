<h3>Wed Feb 26, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:20)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> does anybody know _who_ at SLAC manages the LSST VOMS (server?)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Wei, iirc<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> If it's the same one as supercdms<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah looks like it is<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> I already reached out to him about their InCommon cert though. It doesn't expire until August so we have time on that one<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:40)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> In order to add voms attribs to a proxy, does VOMS/voms-proxy-direct need to trust the issuer? i.e. can someone sign a cert issued by the CILogon Basic CA?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I'm still working on the Bellarmine ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:37)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> looks like Bellarmine is not one of the identity providers for CILogon so they'd have to use Github/Google/ORCID or something as their identity provider<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:02)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> which might be a no go for having them use VOMS auth for xrootd<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> I think it should work as long as the VOMS server trusts the issuer of the cert<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:59)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> that was exactly my question<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:14)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> and we don't include CILogon Basic in osg-ca-certs, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> I believe we do<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:12)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> wait, is it CILogon Basic or CILogon OpenID that you get when you use Google as your provider?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:51)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah it's OpenID, and we don't include that<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> We package it separately and it's available in the release repos<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> So if they can convince Wei to install it, they could have a path forward there<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:38)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> OK, I pinged Wei.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:18)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> As a side note, as OSG employees, are we allowed to recommend Globus Connect? What with it being a paid third-party service and all that...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:35:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't see why not, especially if we can't meet their requirements<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(17:55:47)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I like that their sales people finally stopped hitting us up @ Vanderbilt<br/>

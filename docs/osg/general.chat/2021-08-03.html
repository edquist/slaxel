<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:20)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> OSG repo down?<br/><a href="https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/">https://repo.opensciencegrid.org/osg/</a> …<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:54)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> back… looks like it was just a glitch<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:12:41)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> A brief outage for a software update (intended to make future updates more seamless). Thank you for pointing it out!<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:24)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Argh. And another short outage, due to flux being very helpful. And we're back.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Anyone know anything about a High Energy Physics Software Foundation (HSF)?<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67764">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/67764</a><br/>I’m not sure why they would want to execute a training on OSG Connect, but I don’t think we’re interested in supporting it either.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:13)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, the JLab All Hands was an HSF/OSG/WLCG workshop<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:52)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yeah, they are a big deal in the HEP community.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:00)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> US and Europe, at least.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:24)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> But as you wrote, why would they want to use OSG Connect?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:00)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> perhaps they want to use the Connect platform more generally? We are supporting e.g. CMS Connect, the Snowmass process, and our UChicago ATLAS Analysis Facility via Connect.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @lincoln Interesting. I’ll see what they say, and whom they’ve talked to or been pointed by.<br/>

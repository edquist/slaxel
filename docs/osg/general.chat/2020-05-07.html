<h3>Thu May 7, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Is CMVFS supported outside of OSG contexts? Like, can a cluster enable it without being part of OSG or part of CMS?<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64933">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64933</a><br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:23)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yes. I have it set up on my laptop for example.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:50)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> There might be some manual configuration necessary, particularly of squid servers.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:04)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> For that ticket, it should be redirected to Marian.  We just need to replicate that hsf repo to the OSG replicas.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @marian it’s all yours!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yea, we have it for example on a bunch of XSEDE machines<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:48)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yeah, but it’s still for OSG-related use when implemented on XD resources, right? I guess I’m asking under the possibility that someone finds/wants to use CMS software on their otherwise isolated server or cluster (that’s not part of OSG or CMS). Is it true that anyone can add/support CVMFS on their cluster or server, or is there some authorization on the end of OSG/CMS?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> No authorization<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah, okay then! But we (OSG, or someone else?) are still responsible for supporting anyone wanting to use CVMFS, even in cases not related to OSG or CMS? (just clarifying, not questioning)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> they'll want to setup their local setup to access the CVMFS repos directly instead of via squid, though<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we get angry emails from CERN / US-LHC when they see access via a squid that's not registered in the OSG / WLCG<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:23)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Yeah, but they see 10k connections coming from my NAT box and all the sudden I'M the bad guy<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> lol<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> "Support" for this is a difficult question.  I suppose it's like all other software in the OSG.  If people use the software but not for OSG like purposes, do we support that?  We are not the upstream for CVMFS software, but we are for our OSG configuration of CVMFS.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, it kinda depends where they actually get their installation of CVMFS from<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if they get it from us and they have a problem, we'd probably try to help them but wouldn't bend over backwards to do it if they're not claiming affiliation with OSG / CMS<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:02:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, unclaimed GlideinWMS tix have been there for several days<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:02:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @lmichael, I updated <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64933">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64933</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:03:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> we'd need few more info and few more steps to accomplish this<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:06:34)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> re tix you mentioned I assigned them to people that should look after them<br/>

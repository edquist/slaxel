<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:33)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I had an engagement two weeks ago with someone who is running a Galaxy instance and is interested in using OSG as the backend for running jobs.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:56)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Is there anyone in our community/team who has experience with Galaxy and HTCondor integration?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Flightworthy, but I’m not sure OSG wants to accept the security vulnerabilities that Galaxy servers bring.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:55)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Miron has (had?) strong feelings, u less something has changed.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:32:30)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ah, that’s good to know<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:50)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I could use some help assigning this ticket. It might be for @paschos, but others feel free to chime in:<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65807">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65807</a><br/><pre>I'm a new OSG user on the g4PSI project (username ch4mi). I wish to work with software written by my collaboration (LUXZEPLIN or LZ, on /cvmfs/lz.opensciencegrid.org/). </pre><br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:25)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i can work with the user and check his scripts --- but as far as tracing the history behind the luxzeplin image in /cvmfs/<a href="http://singularity.opensciencegrid.org">singularity.opensciencegrid.org</a>.. someone else might be better positioned to figure this out<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:45)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i assigned to me --- at least for the initial contact--- i have not assigned it to any particular group<br/>

<h3>Tue Jul 9, 2019 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:40)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> I have a team member who would like to receive the software release announcements. How do they subscribe?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tim.theisen sends them to all site admins, the osg-sites mailing list, and maybe another one?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:34)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:03)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> ugh I just found out the release announcements are sent from "<a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>" so they get filtered into my Freshdesk folder<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:50)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> yeah, that was why I was asking!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tim.theisen maybe we should just send the email as whoever's sending the announcement with the reply-to set to help@?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:38)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> same for security announcements<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> what does security use for their 'from' field?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if they use <a href="mailto:security@opensciencegrid.org">security@opensciencegrid.org</a> or security-team that may be reasonable<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:44)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> no they use <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a> too<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:09)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> they use "OSG Security Team" as the name<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @zalak @stanfiem where would you like response to security announcements to go? as of now it sounds like they're probably being turned into freshdesk tickets<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:26)</span> <b>zalak:</b></span> Either to the <a href="mailto:security@opensciencegrid.org">security@opensciencegrid.org</a> mailing list or in the form of freshdesk tickets with some kind of notification to the security team.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:15)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> It is all in the osg-notify script. Perhaps a little updating there is required.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, i think so<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tim.theisen maybe we should add a section here (<a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/release/notes/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/release/notes/</a>) that describes who we send our announcements to (i.e. site admins) and how someone can subscribe to announcements (sign up for osg-general?)<br/>

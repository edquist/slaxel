<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(06:01:54)</span> <b>tbritton:</b></span> I received an email, they are a new-to-OSG project at JLab for which I have created the project yaml for.  They have access to the submit node and I am not worried about getting them up an running.  Thanks for sending them my way<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(07:51:49)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Thank YOU for helping out! Much appreciated. :tada:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:51)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> If someone is working w/ icecube, who should I direct them to for OSG access?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:02)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> We got an OSG Connect account request but I don’t think that’s the right place for this person.<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:38)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> In general all members of IceCube should have access to submit to OSG via their grid submission node, <a href="http://sub-1.icecube.wisc.edu">sub-1.icecube.wisc.edu</a>.<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:30)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> @Christina Koch I just checked with Benedikt, and this user wants to do something a little unusual for IceCube namely using stashcache, which they don't currently have a way to support themselves. So, it sounds like she knows what she is doing and should be approved.<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:25)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> Longer term, I can imagine that if stashcache works well for her there may be reason to work with IceCube to enable them to put their own stuff on the caching network.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @matyas has space in the GLOW origin set aside for IceCube, iirc<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:11)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thanks @cnweaver<br/>

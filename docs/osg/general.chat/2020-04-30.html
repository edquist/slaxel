<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:51:08)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have a CHTC user (GLOW VO) whose jobs are failing on a <tt><a href="http://cabinet-2-2-14.t2.ucsd.edu">cabinet-2-2-14.t2.ucsd.edu</a></tt> due to ‘FATAL: kernel too old’ error. Jobs run successfully pretty much everywhere else.<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:06:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Okay, this should be directed at the admin of the site (UCSD), b/c my user is not using Singularity as part of her job; it’s being invoked by the pilot. Who should get tagged in?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:08:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hmm, could be something I'm doing with Singularity. What are the job requirements?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(18:58:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <tt>(Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7) &amp;&amp; (OpSysName =!= "Debian") &amp;&amp; ((Poolname =!= "CHTC") &amp;&amp; (TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site =!= "UCSD")) &amp;&amp; (TARGET.Arch == "X86_64") &amp;&amp; (TARGET.OpSys == "LINUX") &amp;&amp; (TARGET.Disk &gt;= RequestDisk) &amp;&amp; (TARGET.Memory &gt;= RequestMemory) &amp;&amp; (TARGET.HasFileTransfer)</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:12:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> My best guess is that they are landing on a ubuntu image, but that should have been tested and prevented being used.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:12:25)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'll try to do some testing on this tomorrow<br/>

<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:09)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Issue for CentOS8 (or either stream) was closed asap :smile: OSG Folks and also @andrew.melo - what is the guidelines/plans from OSG/Experiment (CMS mainly) for OS? Or is this still undefined?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:51)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I assume for your gridftp/xrootd hosts?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:27)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> not only, but also squids, wns, ces, collector, interactive nodes,perfsonar<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:37)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I want to say that everything except wn is 100% OK, if the software works<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> And I'm &gt;95% sure WN is okay too since we run in singularity, but I'm not certain on that one<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:24:20)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> wn are fine with condor from wisc repo. The only issue is cms pilots (python2/3 related). We already have WNs on CC8.  My main issue being - we keep migrating to CC8 all and if later in the year OSG/CMS decides to move to not rhel based - More work to migrate again…<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I'm not the one making the decisions, but I'm 95% sure OSG is going to keep sticking with RPMs. We would need to completely switch build systems if we wanted to build Debs.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:55)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> From CMS' side, I've not heard of us moving off RHEL-based, the question is what "flavor" of RHEL are we using<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:52)</span> <b>dart:</b></span> Based on what I’m hearing at the moment, it’s premature to make a decision in this space. It’s not yet clear whether another group will create and sustain a RHEL clone to replace CentOS or not. The project’s I’m working with are adopting a wait and see stance for now.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @justas.balcas - CERN has rather definitively stated they aren't moving off a RPM-based setup.  Tim Bell's group gave a nice outline of the options at the GDB on Wednesday.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:50)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> ok :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:54)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:52)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> that means SUSE is still on the table! :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:20)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> In principle, all we really care about for the WNs is cvmfs and singularity, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:56)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah - that's something that protects us in WLCG-land.  The people on the LHC trigger farms have a bigger headache.<br/>

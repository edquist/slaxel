<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:22)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all -- to follow up with @andrew.meloâ€™s question, is a github PR the de-facto way to go to submit addition and change requests for site/resource/vo records, or would emailing a  patch to support@ or some other address be equally or more effective?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:26)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Also, when adding a new site (as I'm bringing up a new site), it looks like the id# in the SITE.yaml needs to somehow link up to site.tab, but with a grep of that repo I can't tell if site.tab is OK to edit directly or if it should be generated from somewhere else (in which case, how is the id# determined or recorded?)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:08:30)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> for the 2nd q, there's some scripts under bin/ that will get the next unused ID for you<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:31)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> I'm actually just noticing that the ID fields i'm worried about aren't actually listed in the templates -- do these get added by OSG staff later?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I think that's just an oversight<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:45)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> right-o.  Thx, i'll look into those scripts!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:01)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> @ian_cancercomputer, you can send a patch or a request to change things to <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a> and we'll take care of it<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:36)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> also, we don't use site.tab anymore. it was created when we did the initial import from the OIM database<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:45)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I should delete it so people don't get confused<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:01)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:54)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Ian, can you send the second patch as an attachment, or put it on pastebin or make a gist or something? The ticket system messed up the spacing and it doesn't apply<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (the first one had that problem too but I took care of it by hand)<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:40)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Sure, try this?  <a href="http://dpaste.com/0CAHYVJ.txt">http://dpaste.com/0CAHYVJ.txt</a><br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:45:21)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> i'm setting up a github account now so any future ones can just be done via PR..  probably should've done that to begin with..<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:55)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Now that the GOC doesn't exist, what's the procedure to request space on OASIS?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:15)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Also, is there a space limit on OASIS?<br/>
<span style="color: #965d1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:13)</span> <b>briedel:</b></span> you mean <tt>/cvmfs</tt>?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I would start with a support ticket here: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> but in the end, it will be adding your DN to whatever VO, then it will grant you gsissh access to the machine.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:31)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> (FWIW, the docs still refer to GOC)<br/>@briedel I mean <tt>/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org</tt> I *think* that's what we want to do instead of hosting our own repo<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:09)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Can you point me to the docs you are looking at?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:18)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Doc focus this week, good opportunity to fix that.<br/>

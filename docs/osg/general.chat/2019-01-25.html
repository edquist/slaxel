<h3>Fri Jan 25, 2019 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(08:34:30)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Escalating from the #osg-support channel: I got an account request from a CMS person on Monday and was told to contact Kenyi Hurtado to set up their account on CMS Connect instead of OSG Connect.  I have gotten no response from Kenyi.  Is there someone else I should contact? Should I go ahead and just give this person an account on OSG Connect even though theyâ€™re affiliated w/ CMS?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> seems weird -- i believe kevin lannon is kenyi's boss (both at CMS and ND) so maybe try him?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:41)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thanks @blin will contact him.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:41)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @rwg can you weigh in on my message from earlier today? who is the lead for CMS Connect?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> It's Kenyi, IIRC - Do you need Kevin's email?<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:13)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> @christinalk its Kenyi<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, I emailed <a href="mailto:khurtado@nd.edu">khurtado@nd.edu</a>  - is that the right address?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:21)</span> <b>khurtado:</b></span> Hi @christinalk, that is the right email address, but I can't find your email for some reason. Did you use <a href="mailto:ckoch5@wisc.edu">ckoch5@wisc.edu</a>  ? Anyway, we can use slack too.<br/>

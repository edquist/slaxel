<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:29)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hello <b>@channel</b> , i'm seeing job failures due to missing LIGO data despite having <tt>HAS_LIGO_FRAMES==True</tt> in my requirements.  The jobs seem to be landing at UCSD, which i did not think hosted LIGO data.  I'll set up some +DESIRED_Sites runs in a minute, but does anyone see an obvious error with that requirement?<br/>

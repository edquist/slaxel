<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(07:13:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Agreed. There ought to be (like RT).<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:15:49)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I don't think any of my cleanup would have affected that (but I highly encouraged others on Ops to review things yesterday).  I did assign a few tickets already labeled Ops to folks in the Ops team.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:16:12)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Also - do we really not have a CCStar tag?  Am I just missing it somewhere?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:45:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think i created one called <tt>CC*</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> hm :confused: search couldn't find it.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> oh wait, maybe it's <tt>CCStar</tt> after all <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/search?orderBy=created_at&amp;orderType=desc&amp;q[]=tags%3A%5B%22CCStar%22%5D&amp;ref=5000319518">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/search?orderBy=created_at&amp;orderType=desc&amp;q[]=tags%3A%5B%22CCStar%22%5D&amp;ref=5000319518</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> let’s start using <tt>CCStar</tt>, if that’s what @blin has been using<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:06)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :wink: I may or may not have created that today.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:29)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I think I also accidentally created a "CCStan" ... that text box makes it too easy to typo things.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:01:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> huh ok. i did think i tagged something as <tt>CC*</tt> the other day but i guess that doesn't work with FreshDesk search :anguished:<br/>

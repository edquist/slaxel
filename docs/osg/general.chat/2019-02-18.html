<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(18:26:16)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>,  does <tt>+SingularityImage</tt> *have* to point to CVMFS, or can i use e.g., an <tt>shub</tt> url?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(18:26:50)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> please don't use "at channel" :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:04:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think we are not doing any checking on that, so try an shub url<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:04:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> You probably do not want that if you are running a large number of jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:05:09)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> And we might enforce /cvmfs in the future<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(19:10:24)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Thanks, i'll give it a shot.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(20:25:45)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> *please* do not do it with a large number, say more than 10 or so, jobs because shub is not designed to serve large numbers.  It does not have the caching of cvmfs, nor the efficiency of only downloading the pieces that it accesses.  In addition, we are moving the grid toward unprivileged singularity, and it will only be able to work with unpacked directories like in cvmfs because mounting a loopback device is a privileged operation.  The OSG singularity install instructions also encourages people to disable loopback devices even with privileged singularity, so you may find that it does not work at some sites.<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(20:26:07)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> Regarding Andrew’s request to not use “at channel”, he wants you to instead use “at here”<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(20:26:52)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @james.clark<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(21:39:57)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Understood, thanks.  Indeed, this is for single jobs / setting up a new workflow while i wait for the cvmfs image to show up<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(21:44:47)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> the 'at channel' thing was my complaint<br/>

<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:21)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> @tmartin what version did you downgrade to? Not the newest in EPEL? I’d argue building newer version (and yes, the spec has been broken since like ~2.18 or something and building isn’t trivial) is better than relying on older versions, but if it works go for it<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:33)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> I don’t remember the details, but full 100% working mixed v4 and v6 failover and failback never worked out for me with the version in EPEL, but if you get it tested and working at scale with an older version great — probably easier to document than going the latest and greatest route<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Do we have a build in Koji?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:44)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> nope … I intended to, and then had to do enough shenanigans to make it build at all I wanted to wait for the issues to be fixed upstream, and looking at the latest changelogs there’s mention of corrected spec file issues, so perhaps the issue is closed on github<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:52)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> you should totally build it in your infinite time :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> That's actual work, not a phone meeting.  I can't do that.<br/>

<h3>Mon Jun 1, 2020 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:52:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, Lots of new tix for Software, GlideinWMS, and Operations teams<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:38)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> The below has been waiting a while, maybe because it came into the GlideinWMS queue. Does the GlideinWMS team pay attention to their unclaimed tix?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65039">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65039</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Iâ€™ve reassigned to Software (am I right?) and it needs to get urgent priority, given COVID-19 and Oklahoma context. (We like Horst, right? :smiley:)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:15:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> unfortunately that's a factory config change so it's not in software's court<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> (glideinwms is the right group to assign this to)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we could submit a PR to <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-gfactory">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-gfactory</a> but we don't really know the ins and outs of factory config<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @jdost321 ^^<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:38)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> this ticket 65039 never made it to the factory ops list.. i just added it in cc manually / re-assigned to glideinwms<br/>

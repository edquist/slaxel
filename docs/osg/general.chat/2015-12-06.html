<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:48)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> I want to parse a Condor submit file and add/modify one attribute (after which I can either submit the job via the Python bindings or write it back to disk and submit via command line).  <br/><br/>I was hoping the Condor python bindings would have code to parse submit files, but it doesn't look like it.  Is the trick to use <tt>condor_submit -dump my_file.classad my_file.submit</tt> and then feed that into the classad?  Is there a better way?<br/>

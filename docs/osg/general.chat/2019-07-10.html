<h3>Wed Jul 10, 2019 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Help: I’ve got a Mitchell Clement who switched institutions and research groups, but doesn’t know which project they were a part of, and/or how to update their SSH key (if, as they think, they were using CILogon and not Globus).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:38:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Not sure if it’s even possible to look up the various projects that a person is part of, via Globus. I can see that this person is a part of the ‘osg’ group, when I specifically look at that group, but not sure otherwise. @rynge?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:44:10)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @christinalk was able to pull up a user’s Globus group at our meeting on Monday, she might be able to tell you how she did that.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:47)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Usually you can just look them up in the ticket system, and you will find the join ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:01)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> However, I don't see one for Mitchell Clement<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:52)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> There is a chance they never had access via Connect<br/>

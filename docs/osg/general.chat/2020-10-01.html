<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Did someone auto-assign a bunch of tix?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe? I know @bbockelm was working through some Ops ticket backlogs<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:49)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> hmph. We’ve got some mix-ups in the RF team as a result, where some new tickets were assigned to people who wouldn’t normally take them (e.g. me, at least) and who weren’t able to respond in our usual timeframe, but no one else on the team grabbed them in time b/c they were already assigned.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> there should be a way to see the history of ticket actions within the ticket so you can figure out who to talk to about it :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

<h3>Fri Aug 7, 2015 : #general (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:30)</span> <b>dgc:</b></span> <b>@group</b> If there’s anyone else who should be in this Slack team, please let me know and I’ll send invitations<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> maybe Tim Cartwright? It's been a year I never succeed add his AIM into my gtalk and vice-versa so slack seems to be promising way get in contact finally :simple_smile: ... though, that's just my wish ...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:57)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I think Brian’s (and mine) eventual goal is to have the software team on this slack instance.  Though, no promises.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:38)</span> <b>dgc:</b></span> btw, the IRC and XMPP integrations are enabled on this slack instance, so you should be able to use this with whatever irc/jabber client you like.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:50)</span> <b>dgc:</b></span> although personally I’ve gotten quite accustomed to the slack client<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, as I'm already in other slack team I installed mac app they provide, it's nice<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so to use both teams in one interface this is good, won't mix it with my other chat clients, at least for now<br/>

<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:42)</span> <b>scotwk:</b></span> I'm running Condor 8.4.7 and I have an odd file named <tt>2&gt;</tt> in my log directory.  It's a stack trace.  I was going to drop a line to condor-admin, but figured I'd check here first in case anyone knew about this:<br/><br/><pre>$ cd /var/log/condor<br/>[0] 18:10:15 UTC [skronenf@csiu:condor]$ ll<br/>total 168520<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 condor condor 22078249 Oct  4 18:10 2&gt;<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 condor condor  5056732 Oct  4 18:10 CollectorLog<br/>-rw-r--r-- 1 condor condor 10486046 Oct  3 13:53 CollectorLog.old<br/></pre><br/><br/>I'm wondering if something in Condor is crashing and the usual <tt>&gt;/somewhere 2&gt;&amp;1</tt> is typo'ed.  (Or maybe it's something I'm running locally, although I don't think I'm running anything other than the condor service as the <tt>condor</tt> user)<br/>

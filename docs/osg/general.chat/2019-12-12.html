<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:08)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> @lmichael getting our approval for the white-list is very easy, pretty well anything that can be associated to or applicable to cancer research or cancer researchers applies.  If you can send us an email (<a href="mailto:ian@cancercomputer.com">ian@cancercomputer.com</a> or <a href="mailto:roy@cancercomputer.com">roy@cancercomputer.com</a>) with the descriptions we can likely get back to you within a day.  Also, I believe the whitelist can accept wildcards so it might be easier for @rynge to set up the filter based on a particular substring of the project names being the same for all of the projects you're trying to set up, as I have the impression based on what I scanned above that there could be a lot of them?  Also2, I expect that I will be rebuilding our OSG clusters over the holidays to make sure they're able to provide sufficient resources to each of these jobs, so if you happen to know what sort of resource requirements these proposed projects will need per job it would be helpful for me if you could include that in the description--just basic memory/storage/number-of-cores requirements.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hi @ian_cancercomputer our users of OSG from UW-Madison are effectively ONLY running single-core jobs, but their memory requirements may be as high as 10GB per core (and per job). I’m working on getting decent 2-sentence descriptions from the projects I have in mind, then will send your way. *I* am currently the hold-up, as some other things have become higher-priority in the last few days.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m anticipating something in the neighborhood of 10 projects, but not all of those will always be running jobs (maybe 2-5).<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @scotwk: yeah, it’s unfortunate that condor submit file parsing isn’t doable by the python bindings.  It turns out that all of the submit logic is found in global variables in submit.cpp; to provide a library interface (even thread-unsafe), we’d need to reimplement or refactor a huge amount of code.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:28)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> anyone familiar with the specific differences in FreshDesk between creating a “New Ticket” versus a “New Email” ?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> When creating a new ticket, does the ‘Contact’ that I identify receive an email?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:59)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> If you want to send an email to someone, use new email<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:22:15)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m not sure that answers my question. I want to end up with a new ticket, and I want the contact/requestor to receive my  “Description” as body text in the email.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:22:28)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Why would I use New Email and not New Ticket, and vice versa?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:26:30)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Ah, I just created a ticket to see — I knew there was a reason I’d switched to email but couldn’t remember.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:00)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> If you use “new ticket” (I just created one w/ you as the contact), it shows up as “Lauren Michael reported via phone”<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:42)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> If you use “new email”, it functions more like a request initiated by us, as the page describes at the top (“When you hit send, the contact will receive an email and a ticket will be associated with them.“)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:28:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Did you get an email from the ticket I created w/ you as the contact?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:29:46)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Got it. Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, that’s lame (for New Ticket), as in, it doesn’t really make sense (the phone part, etc.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> and when I created the New Email, the ticket got marked as ‘closed’?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Agree! <br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think the 'closed' part is a feature - you are basically sending information to the user, and if they reply the ticket will open.<br/>

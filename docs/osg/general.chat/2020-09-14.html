<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i.e. all grid users go into a grid accounting group and all local users go into a local accounting group and you set up your rank expression as such<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you could also probably skip adding all your local users to their own accounting group and subtract from rank if the "accountinggroup == grid"<br/>

Globus OnLine is the recommended way to access USQCD data.<br/>We are removing all references to ILDG from the <a href="http://USQCD.ORG">USQCD.ORG</a> web pages.<br/>We apologize for the effort you had to spend investigating our out of date web pages."<br/>

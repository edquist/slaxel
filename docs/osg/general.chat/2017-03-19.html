<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:13:56)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all -- i just took a quick browse at the gracc results for my facility, and on the 15th of march the payload wallhours are double what they are normally; given OSG is on a dedicated cluster I'm wondering how this might be possible in any real terms, or if this might be some sort of double-reporting error?  <a href="http://goo.gl/mwxQAK">http://goo.gl/mwxQAK</a><br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:15)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> (i don't want to file a bug if this can occur from normal behaviour)<br/>

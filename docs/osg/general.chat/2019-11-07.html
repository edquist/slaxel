<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:58)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I have a slightly silly FreshDesk question. Is a closed ticket preferential to a resolved ticket? I’m trying to understand the purpose of this automation - <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/admin/automations/time_triggers/5000449328/edit">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/admin/automations/time_triggers/5000449328/edit</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the only real difference is that resolved sends a survey to the user<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:42)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Is there a purpose for the automation rule then? It seems to take resolved tickets and converts them to closed. (I don’t really care either way, but it triggers an additional email to me which made me curious)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:04:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think the idea is that resolved = agent believes the ticket is resolved<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:04:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if the user disagrees then it'll be thrown back to open<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:02)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but if not, then the issue is truly done<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:46)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> But this change isn’t prompted by any user interaction (that I can see). It just appears to take any resolved tickets and change them to closed 48 hours later.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, exactly<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it gives the user a 48 hr window to disagree with the agent's decision to resolve the ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:52)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Do resolved tickets not get reopened with a user reply like closed ones?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it's probably worth thinking whether or not 48 hours is enough for us<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> closed tickets can't get reopened by the user?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> all tickets get reopened if a user responds<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:12)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Closed tickets can, we use this feature regularly to “pause” onboarding tickets.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:29)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I’m wondering why they aren’t just left in the resolved state then.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i believe the idea is that resolved is meant to indicate a ticket that we think is done but it wouldn't be unexpected if a user responds otherwise<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> closed = tickets where it would be unexpected if a user responds<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:40)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Hmm ok<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> all that being said, i think that's just what the intention is<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i always just close tickets these days because i don't care for the user surveys<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:31)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ me too<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it's on my todo list to write a freshdesk user guide and it may actually happen since we're trying to get @didavila on our triage duty :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:51)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> That would be helpful. I’ve realized I mentally slot resolved as a more completed state than closed. It would be nice to have a reference :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

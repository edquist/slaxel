<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It has been working fine<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @mkandes What we need is also let Jeremy know we are ready and hand him the VM<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:50)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I also want us to have a way to give them an updated VM if we need any changes.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:06)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We are only handing over the compute nodes right?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @rynge, I looked at OSG_US_FIU_HPCOSGCE, they fail on crl-check glidein validation tests, indeed ... also, per our records in JIRA, we often open ticket to this site with every same reason ... once they fix, they run good for some time and again crls expires ... not sure why it's so hard for them to configure cron which should take care of it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> do we have some good friends there that someone can explain them the issue in english?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:53)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I don't know any<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:36:01)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So it keep on coming back?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, well, three times this year<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> but always same thing<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah that is frustrating. Just difficult to give a site a talking to when you are an opportunistic VO coming in using their resources for free<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> understood<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I will open ticket to them in next days if things don't get fixed ... We have similar sites and sometimes they fix it before we open ticket to them<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @blin: best bet would be <a href="mailto:osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu">osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian is that list public?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, I think anyone can write there but it's mostly for Factory Operators ... if you have something to discuss more private talk to Jeff then directly<br/>

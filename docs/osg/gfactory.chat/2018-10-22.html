<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:56)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Hi, I was just looking at this DUNE entry for the new BNL cluster (<a href="http://spce01.sdcc.bnl.gov">spce01.sdcc.bnl.gov</a>). The max wall time is set to 17100. I assume it was supposed to be 171000. Do we need a ticket to fix it?<br/>

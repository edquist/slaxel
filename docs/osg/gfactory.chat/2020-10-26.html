<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:04:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Do we have support for mixed EL7/EL8 sites? Can that be auto detected and the correct tarball be downloaded?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:13)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> Hi Mats, Expanse was sort of our guinea pig to try and learn how to run glideins on EL8 sites. the auto detection script has been set up to properly pull the EL8 tarball when it lands on those nodes<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:04)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> it looks like in production at least it will currently only work if you're asking for condor 8.9 tarballs<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I was actually thinking about my own site where we are starting to have EL8 machines in the pool<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I know that in the past we have been picky about pinning a site to a specific OS version<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:10)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> My question is if there we can relax it at least for some sites to be "whatever worker we land on, pull the right OS tarball"<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:57)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> if you set CONDOR_OS to "auto" it will just try to pick the right one. but if you ask for anything otehr than 8.9.x or some specific 8.9 version it won't find a match. However we can also add 8.8.x for rhel8 tarballs to the factory we just haven't eyt<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:24)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> what specific versions does OSG flock ask for if any?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:59)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> we can try to explicitly set things in the entries but if the FE overrides any of the varaibles it wins over the entry<br/>

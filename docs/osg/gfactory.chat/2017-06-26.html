<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:50)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> @amjad what's the story with the CERN factory?  I saw your email but want to put my factory in downtime asap so I can reshoot next week.  Do you know what happened or need help with it?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:05)</span> <b>amjad:</b></span> Hi,<br/><br/>glideinwms service went down by bunch of the IO space errors, now everything is running and stable, but still investigating<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:07)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> ok. do you think it is safe for me to put my factory in downtime?  i talked with dave mason last week and since tier0 is in shutdown next week, i'd like to have my factory drained so i can reinstall ~july 5th or 6th<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:55)</span> <b>amjad:</b></span> So far I do not see any errors, you good to proceed I will keep my eyes on factory during week and weekend till you back up.<br/>

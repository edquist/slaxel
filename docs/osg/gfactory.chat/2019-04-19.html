<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:38:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i thought @marco.mascheroni thought it was a CE thing<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:00)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> is this hosted CE?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:06)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'll take a look from factory side ... otherwise I don't have access to it<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:15)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> Marian, if you can take first pass, if you show the CE is still not working correctly I can take it from there<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:02)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I see from the email thread it looks ike Marco had to restart condor, maybe it's not staying up<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, that's what I saw and thought there is nothing to do from Factory side ... I'm checking...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, I think it detects CE as down:<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sure, do you want me comment on the email?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:50)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> sure, just that you see it's down from the factory side should be enough<br/>

I was wondering if maybe the cc got messed up and no one was seeing it?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey ken, how are you adding comments to the ticket? via email?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:31)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> No, through the web interface.<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I can confirm we're receiving updates from Ken ... Actually right after the last update I sent email to Jeff take care of it on his shift since this has been long requested already ... I just just did now and reconfig'd, sorry Ken for waiting that long!<br/>

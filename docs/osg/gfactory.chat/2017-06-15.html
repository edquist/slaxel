<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(08:22:04)</span> <b>amjad:</b></span> @marian , any idea why GOCITB factory monitoring stopped?  I restarted http daemon and check ports all fine.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hmm, could be due upgrade to 3.2.19?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:28:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm away of computer now, go ahead and poke around or simply downgrade to see if it fixes issue... <br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(08:30:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> The monitoring pages was the thing I didn't check after upgrade. You or @jdost321 may follow up or I'll take a look later tonight. Tomorrow I wanted take the day off but let me know if you need me back on track.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(08:35:37)</span> <b>amjad:</b></span> Sure, I will check it out<br/>

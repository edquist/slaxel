<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(09:02:10)</span> <b>peter.couvares:</b></span> @marian re: 10k factory limit, we do hope to exceed that in a few weeks yes -- anything we should do now to prepare?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi @peter.couvares, default settings on the factory side are <tt>&lt;per_entry glideins="10000" held="1000" idle="4000"/&gt;</tt>. Unless there are any entries they have yet another limitation, e.g, <tt>&lt;per_frontend...&gt;</tt> for individual entries the only thing to worry about would be how the CE handles that all. If you can tell me what CE's you're about to hit we can also check on the factory we have things wide open that Factory doesn't block you in any way. Though, I'd be personally cautions that we don't make too big havoc rather than you'll try gradually increase the demand. Also, it's all about Frontend to request new pilots, so you should be aware of keeping pressure from the job submission side get things to saturate at max limit toward CEs for LIGO supported entries. All over, now I'm thinking of why not use ITB Factory or even LIGO ITB Frontend for these tests, or are you already beyond that point and all should be good to hit in production? I'm just curious about the workflow here that we can best accommodate your plan on the Factory side, too...<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:05)</span> <b>peter.couvares:</b></span> @joshua.willis can you give @marian and @dweitzel an idea of the likely timing and scale of the O2 re-runs over the next few weeks?<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:53)</span> <b>peter.couvares:</b></span> We'll be trying to maximize opportunistic resources everywhere, as well as our COMET allocation.  It will be an urgent push for LIGO, so I'd like to make sure we're ready beforehand.  Any tests that would be helpful for us to run now, let us know.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I see, I believe that from the Factory side you shouldn't be limited assuming opportunistic CEs will have enough of resources for LIGO jobs ... so, the really thing to keep a pressure will be submission side, the Frontend ... from Factory Ops we could at least watch more closely opportunistic entries and see whether things glide in there and run or not for some reason. Would that help if Factory Operators are aware and keep  eyes closer to those resources in particular?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Monday is probably a good day - OSG VO will not be running due to the frontend move, so you should see some extra cycles on the machine we are competing on<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(14:53:09)</span> <b>peter.couvares:</b></span> Thanks @marian and @rynge.  @joshua.willis can you submit a really big test run on Monday (assuming the production run is not yet ready to go)?  Also, please keep folks in this channel updated with the likely production run timing, so they can keep an eye out for us when we launch...<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:58)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Also make sure the jobs are long enough for the pressure to be noticed and give the pool a chance to scale up. It does take some time.<br/>

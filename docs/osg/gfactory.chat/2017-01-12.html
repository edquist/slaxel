<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:57)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Okay, I'm done for the day, if you want to take over this afternoon and tomorrow morning. One site I would probably follow-up with and open a ticket is CMSHTPC_T2_CH_CSCS_arcbrisi. Unusual held message. Maybe they are in downtime though.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> alright, I can take over then ... did you mean I should open ticket for CMSHTPC_T2_CH_CSCS_arcbrisi or do you still want to do it now?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:19)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yes, can you open a ticket with them via GGUS.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sounds good<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:28)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> can you guys remind me, we should not be using shared port for anything on the factory, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, at least it's set to FALSE on SDSC factory ... and I believe on others, too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> USE_SHARED_PORT=false<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:47)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> that's what i thought, thanks<br/>

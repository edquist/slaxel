<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:28)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I removed my jobs - let me know when you want to test again<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:41)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @gattebury @jthiltges @dweitzel ^^^ you guys in today?  I'm at the zoo.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:18)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i am wondering if anyone has seen this elsewhere.  we have pilots that get submitted to gpgrid, they start and then fail because of an expired proxy.  they get held and then the factory releases them and they can restart (sometimes successfully) but the ones they fail they suck in a job before the failure causing issues.  from everything we can see, proxies are current (my factory, gwms frontend, ces, pilots).  it also seems to not be factory specific.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:05)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I have, this is usually because the jobs were in the queue for a while and the CE wasn’t able to update/renew the proxies while the job was queued<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:01)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> not sure if that’s quite the same issue since I’ve seen it with hosted ce (HTCondor BOSCO CE) instances<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:08)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> What causes the update failure?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:01)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> For the hosted CE instance, condor doesn’t have a way to update the proxy so it simply ages as the job sits in the queue with no way for the proxy to get updated<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:33)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Not sure if that is also happening for the gpgrid jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:04:34)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> where do you see the expired proxy?  everywhere we look it is current<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:10:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> What is the current version of the condor tarball? I'm currently using 8.4.8<br/>

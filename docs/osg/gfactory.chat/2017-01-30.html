<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:01)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Hi everybody, what what I can see it looks like FNAL connectivity is getting better. Have there been any more problems over the weekend? I saw plenty of OSG jobs on GPGrid.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:34)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Can you have a look for @ken if and when you get a chance today?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:51)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi Marty<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> oh, what ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:30)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I don't think there is a ticket. See discussion above. @kherner, correct me if I am wrong, but the problem reported was connectivity issues between GPGrid entries and OSG Connect. FNAL had to make some changes at network-level last week to help out I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:42)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I'd just do a cursory look at startd logs to gauge how many connectivity errors there are.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:09)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> hopefully they've gone away for the most part.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:54)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I see, sorry I missed Ken's message, now I get it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> will look now @kherner , give me sec<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> at first glance I see from condor activity logs there is really a lot stuff submitted to the GPGrid CEs, fefermifife user ... I don't see anything in held status, just many idle and running glideins waiting for jobs ... I don't see sign of "executed" jobs rather than submitted, btw (looking at one of the entry point) ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> there is about ~900 non-opportunistic glideins running and about ~180 opportunistic ... talking about CEs: gpce0{1,2}.<a href="http://fnal.gov">fnal.gov</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> do you need more info now? I don't see any glidein logs back yet as of today<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner: when I enable it now do you think you'll be asking disable it for tonight if things go wrong or it can be enabled regardless? I was hoping leave office now ... so I might check things later or we postpone push this entry to prod to tomorrow morning ... let me know how urgent it is, please<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> talking about:  <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32162">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32162</a><br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:45)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> It's not really all that urgent if you need to leave now<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm just saying it will be online without possibility to turn off for couple of hours ... until I get home basically<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I can enable it fairly quickly if you're going to do something with it in next couple of hours<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:05)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Oh, a couple of hours is fine<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:12)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I'm going to do something with it as soon as its enabled<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, will do now<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:01)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Thanks! There's really nothing else to test as everything is working well when submitted from our ITB frontend.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:28:35)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok done ... have to go now ... leave me message if it needs to get disabled and I will do later this evening<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:28:48)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> OK, sure. Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:29:24)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> About how long does it take to propagate? I don't see it yet in condor_status<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Related question: On ITB, was there any effort in removing GLIDEIN_Site?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:37)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> you mean for a particular entry or entries? Does it conflict anything in the matchmaking? just trying to understand the request... thanks<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:50)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I used to have GLIDINE_Site as a parameter for limiting the matches, but GWMS started complaining about it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Removing that bit, I'm now getting ITB glideins again<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:14)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I will dig some more on my side and see<br/>

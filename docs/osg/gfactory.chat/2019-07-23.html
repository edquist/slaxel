<h3>Tue Jul 23, 2019 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:23:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @marcom i just got off the production call and i'm a little confused -- Jeff/Ken were saying that the factory was updated to 3.4.5, which triggered a required update of Frontends to 3.4.5<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but i thought you said the factory had updated to 3.5<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(15:27:27)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> No, I said the same. Update to &gt;=3.4.5 of the factory triggers a bug in &lt;=3.4.2 frontends. The bug was fixed in 3.4.3 frontends. The production factories were updated to 3.4.5 that is in OSG production<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:18)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ohhh ok, i misheard/misremembered then<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> also ken mentioned an issue with singularity support in 3.4.5 -- do you guys have a ticket for that?<br/>

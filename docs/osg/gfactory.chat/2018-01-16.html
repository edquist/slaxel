<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:39)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> hey everyone -- I just got my big cluster back online (reverse-dns included). So far as I can tell it's all ready to go but I don't see any jobs coming in yet; is there bychance anything that needs to be re-enabled in the factory for CancerComputer_Hotel_CE ?<br/>

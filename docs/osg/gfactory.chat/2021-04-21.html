<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:11:38)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> To answer my own question, the CentOS7 9.0.0 tarball is 14,530,006 bytes. The glideinWMS tarball is 3,377,187 bytes. However for 9.0.0, constructed tarball has broken symbolic links to the HTCondor Java class files and the condor_ssh_to_job_sshd_config_template.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:32)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> The <tt>condor_gpu_utilization</tt> program is already in the gwms tarball.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:01:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 - I know you're out this morning, but would like to hear your thoughts on simply using upstream's tarballs.  10MB per glidein doesn't sound like too much.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:35)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> pretty sure Miron got upset at having "extra stuff" in those tarballs.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> No - I think Miron got upset at the condor team only releasing monoliths.  It wasn't the size per se.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:31)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> doesn't this count as a monolith?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> or am I thinking of the wrong tarball?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> yes, this counts as a monolith.  I think a fair way to turn around the question is to ask the condor team to maintain a worker node tarball that gWMS can use directly.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> so basically startd + libs + tools?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> plus SSH configs plus condor_chirp plus a few other things.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Anybody with experience with the ELSA site?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:12)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We keep getting reports on cvmfs issues, but I can't figure it out<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think @jpeterson was the one that set up their hosted CE so he's communicated the most with them<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:07)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I’ve at least adjusted some things relating to the CE<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:29)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Do you remember what they did for CVMFS?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:30)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> It is showing about 300 claimed/matched cores pretty consistant since September.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, it is mostly working<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:52)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Could even be a user job issue (jlab)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But from their pov, ELSA is having more issues than others<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:27)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> The CVMFS stuff is all customer side and not impacing the CE itself normally, just what the pilots can report back as available?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:33)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I don’t have anything in my mail history that has TCNJ and CVMFS in it that looks to apply<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:34)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> they don’t look to be running a squid setup.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:54)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> well there is one configured in the CE yaml, but it is currently commented out.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:45)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> the CE was setup in August before I started on them, but the git history looks like it was put in but may not have ever been set to active<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok, I will try do some more digging<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:40)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> I am having some CVMFS issues with another jlab/clas12 site. but that is Lamar<br/>

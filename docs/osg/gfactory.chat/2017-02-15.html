<h3>Wed Feb 15, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is it possible for a factory to submit direct bosco jobs to a site (e.g., not through a Bosco CE)?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:15)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @blin: Yes.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @mkandes are you guys actually doing this anywhere?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:26)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yes, at a few UCLHC sites I believe. Did you need some documentation?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yea, i'd be interested if you've got it<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:22)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> It's been awhile since I looked at this, but I'm guessing it still all works ...<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:23)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> <a href="http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/BoscoSDSC">http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/BoscoSDSC</a><br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:17)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Are you planning on possibly setting up a bosco entry like this for a site?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nah, frank was asking questions and i wasn't aware that this was something you could do at the factory level<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:54)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Gotchya.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you know why the frontend needs to install anything? i would think that the factory needs to submit pilots via bosco but the pilots just report back to the frontend as normal<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:02:44)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yeah, if you wanted to skip most of those steps on the front-end and do it from a different machine, you could do that from the factory. You only really need the ssh key and its path in the front-end.xml file.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:03:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Those steps about the frontend simply assume factory will likely never have ssh access to site we're submitting to. So I guess that's the point of view I had at the time.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:08)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> if I remember correctly.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:24:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah ok, so the factory picks up the ssh key from the frontend and uses it to submit pilots?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:28:26)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Factory never needs the ssh key. So must be some sort of ssh forwarding under the hood or something like that.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:29:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm interesting<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:31:18)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yeah, Marco Mambelli would be the one to talk to if you need more details.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:09)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok, thanks<br/>

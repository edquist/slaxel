<h3>Mon Feb 18, 2019 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian @marco.mascheroni @jdost321 LSU just sent an email saying that we're still sending jobs they're way even though they're not quite ready for them yet. Can someone check to make sure we've disabled the hosted CE entry?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> did they send email to factory ops too? can't find it to figure which entry or entries we're talking about...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nope, it was a select cc list<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it'll be an LSU entry for a <a href="http://hosted-ce23.grid.uchicago.edu">hosted-ce23.grid.uchicago.edu</a><br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:35)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> I thought I already disabled it yesterday. Maybe the fact that I changed its name from OSG_US_LSU_SuperMIC to LIGO_US_LSU_SuperMIC made the rconfig fail. I'll double check<br/>
<span style="color: #e23f99"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:20)</span> <b>marco.mascheroni:</b></span> @blin that was it, it is really disable now. Sorry about that.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:02:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> no worries they were able to stop things on their end, too<br/>

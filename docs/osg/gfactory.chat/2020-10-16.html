<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:53:39)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @rynge great news disk is being set now correctly with Marco Mambelli's patch! I don't want to push the change on a fri to production but we can try early next week<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:02)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> also, i mean its set to DISK to the value we define now.. we still don't know what happens whne a user tries to use more than that amount..<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Great! Well we keep an eye on request_disk for our users<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:28)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So with DISK correctly set, we will probably catch users misbehaving<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:31)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thank you!<br/>

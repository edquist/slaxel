<h3>Wed Sep 20, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey guys, I think this was asked somewhat recently but how many CREAM CE entries do we have in the factories?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the condor team is interested in dropping support<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:11)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> there’s 4 at least that are being actively used for Xenon1T for their reconstruction and monte carlo workflows<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:36)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> that’s for accessing allocations on EGI<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:02)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I think LIGO is planning on doing something similar to get jobs running at EGI sites as well<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:25:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok, do you know what versions of CREAM they're running?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:25:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and where the hell they're getting their source from?<br/>

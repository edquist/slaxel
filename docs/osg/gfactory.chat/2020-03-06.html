<h3>Fri Mar 6, 2020 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:32)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @rynge unassigned doesn't == needing attention in general for factory tickets. Edita who does most site ops isn't an agent so we can't assign them to her<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:00)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I've asked in the past @marco.mascheroni to assign all of hers to himself so they aren't unassigned in the system<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok, as long as they don't sit there unanswered<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:06)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> As an update we discussed this on the ops call, moving forward, whoever is on ops triage will just assign Edita's tickets to Marco directly<br/>

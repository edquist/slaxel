<h3>Tue Jan 31, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner: you should have seen it right away ... let me know it isn't the case<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:05)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I see it in the UCSD factory but not in IU<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:22)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> second-order problem though<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I didn't push it through IU yet<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so that explains<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> will do this afternoon if we consider this entry stay in production factories enabled<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:56)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Let's leave it as-is for now until we get confirmation that the glexec error we saw was transient<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:22:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> shall I do anything re glexec? I guess that's more on Frontend side to investigate...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> if you'd need som logs from factory let me know<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:20)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> No, I don't think we need anything for now. I've actually never seen that "no GIDs available" error before so I'd like to hear what JINR finds on their end.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Sounds like exhausted list of nr of mapped groups or wrong mapping, something on lcmaps side perhaps or whatever other mechanism they use... let's see what they say...<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:24)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Can someone update the glidein-int to 3.2.16  ? I’d like to test out the new fe rpms and I’m not sure if the errors I’m seeing right now are due to version mismatch<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @sthapa, seems it requirs condor-python and that wants update also condor from 8.4.9 to 8.1.10 ... is that ok?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(17:32:32)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(18:12:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> done<br/>

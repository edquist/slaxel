<h3>Fri Jan 27, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(11:20:52)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Is there an issue at OSG_STANFORD_PROCLUS?  The number of glideins there dropped to a quarter of the usual number<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:40)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> BTW are payload jobs going through OK on FNAL_GPGrid? If I go to <a href="http://osg-flock.grid.iu.edu/overview/glideins.php">http://osg-flock.grid.iu.edu/overview/glideins.php</a> I see a pretty high "failure" rate for the FNAL gpce entries, but on further inspection it looks the failed glideins just exited after 20 minutes with nothing to do. So it looks like jobs just didn't match them. If I look at your GPGrid CE monitoring I do see OSG getting plenty of slots now.  So I guess it's just job/node resource mismatches?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:06)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I know Mats' ticket to get our autoblocker exemption updated went through yesterday<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes, are you around?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:07)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @kherner, @sthapa: I'll have a look.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:16)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:30)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Did you need something? Or just pinging me?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:08)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I just double checked and it looks like the number of running jobs has doubled to 57 or so but thatâ€™s still 1/3 of what we can run on the cluster<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> wanted quickly discuss if there is any objection I push -hotpotate entry to production<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and yes, they wanted also rhel7 condor bins to lanuch pilots<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so it should be that way on ITB<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so if we can agree that we push this I'd need to modify also glideinWMS.xml to suppor rhel7 flavor of condor tarball<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:00)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Okay, yeah, go ahead and push the hot potato. I don't see myself making any configuration changes any time soon. Today's been mostly just follow-up on checking new logs.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:17)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Let me know when you're done though.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:05)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's fine, I didn't want you do anything, just wanted to say things have been tested and working well for Brian and CMS, so I just wanted green light move this forward<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that I don't interefere with something when you're doing stuff and we know what changes have been made by me<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (well, will be)<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:18)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> No, yeah, thanks. Two people trying to reconfigure a factory at the same time is always a bad idea. Go ahead and make your changes. Let me know when you're done. I'll just be poking around in logs.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:08)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @sthapa: It looks like there's been recent authentication problems, which I vaguely remember you mentioning somewhere I thought.<br/>

<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:37)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> that error should have been fixed, this looks new<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Failed to authenticate using FS<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:29)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That part looks weird<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Nevermind<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:01)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Hmm. Okay. Well, let me try just removing these held glideins. They could be leftovers. All VOs are pretty much at their max held. If I clear them out, the fresh batch might be a-okay.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:34)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Looks like crls might be out of date, updating<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:58)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, yeah, let's make sure those are up-to-date.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:06)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> give me a sec to update some other osg parts to the latest production release too<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:25)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Will do. I'll take a look at FNAL for Ken while you do that.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:54)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> okay, all done.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:48)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @ken: It looks like over the last day or so there's been a spat of connectivity issues between GPGrid and OSG Connect.<br/>

<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:25)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @kherner: However, it looks like things began improving this morning maybe.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:59)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> So I suspect it was these glideins having trouble connecting back to OSG Connect that you saw with the 20 min lifetimes.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That one we have a ticket for<br/>

<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:07)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> hi all<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:29)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> the ticket for the exemptions is opened and assigned to networking but i don't think they have done anything yet<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Also note that we are working on out advertise / user-job-wrappers so you might see some weirdness (such as 0 jobs matching glideins)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hi klarson1 !<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:53)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> hi mats :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:02)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> it's been a while :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, no rush<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:38)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> FYI - My flight is landing. I'll be offline again for a bit. Let me know if you all need anything else once I get back on, which will probably be in about an hour or two.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes: just fyi - I noticed we run 3.2.14 on CERN factory, didn't know we are so behind ... not sure whether there is a reason for that, but elsewhere we run 3.2.16-1 ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and, I pushed all the changes I needed in, Marty<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and we need to fix sudo on CERN factory:<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> [_gfactory@vocms0805 osg-gfactory]$ sudo service gwms-factory stop<br/>[sudo] password for _gfactory: <br/>Sorry, try again.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> should be passwdless<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:59:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Yes, we never upgraded the CERN factory because of the GLIDEIN_CPUS issue in 3.2.16, which was found after we'd already upgraded the GOC and SDSC factories. And yes, the CERN factories have never had sudo setup. You should always (at least for now) reconfigured as root.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sounds good ... I wasn't sure about reason<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:55)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that sudo I remember we talked with Vassil it's possible to add ... so maybe action item on Amjad on our next call<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> you know it'll be more confortable<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:34)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I just sent email to ourselves in the list to remember<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> also for the record what I did re "hot potato" that people know<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:02:18)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Cool. Sounds good.<br/>

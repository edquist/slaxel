<h3>Mon Feb 26, 2018 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:58)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <b>@here</b> - one thing that will come up in the site support meeting - we need to clean up the factory entries for the USCMS sites that have migrated to Singularity.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:16)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> How will this be supported in the future?  CMS validation scripts, GWMS mechanisms, other?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:33)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Those pieces are already there.  The changes in the factory are to (a) clean out references to glexec and (b) set the <tt>GLIDEIN_Required_OS</tt> to <tt>any</tt>.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:09)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> If the zombie of glexec comes back in the future, we have bigger problems...<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:46)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> so, we will be relying on CMS scripts, not the GWMS built in support?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:43)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> That's TBD.  Last I checked, the gWMS built-in support didn't have the features CMS (or OSG) needed and there wasn't an effective conversation yet moving that forward.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I'd prefer the gWMS built-in support.<br/>

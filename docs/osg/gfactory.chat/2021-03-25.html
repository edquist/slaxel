<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @marcom I still see Singularity jobs running even though the Singularity image is missing<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:38)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre>Thu Mar 25 14:29:11 EDT 2021 ERROR   Unable to access the Singularity image: /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/cnatzke/griffin_simulation:geant4.10.01Â¬<br/>  2         Site and node: SU-ITS-CE2 CRUSH-OSG-C7-10-5-255-186</pre><br/><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:50)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The jobs then keeps running in the wrong environment<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Is this something that was fixed already?<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:50)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> @rynge It has been fixed and will be in the next release, and a patch was provided. Not sure if it was in the one you are using, could you provide me the version ID? It is a debug message in the job (if enabled), something like: GWMS singularity wrapper (...) starting, ...<br/>Then just to be clear. The error is a wrapper error but will happen after the matching of the job, because the job is the one specifying the image.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Right, but the job will fail right there then?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> And not continue on<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:29)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> yes, it will fail. HTCondor may retry it but that instance will fail (however condor is considering the wrapper failure)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Perfect! Thanks!<br/>

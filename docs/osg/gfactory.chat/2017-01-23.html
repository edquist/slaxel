<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:43:25)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @klarson1 : Did you get a chance to check on what version of glideinWMS frontend you all were running for these Stampede tests? Edgar was seeing similar errors in his logs when submitting to Comet last week. He ended up having to downgrade from glideinWMS 3.2.16 to 3.2.15 to get them to go away.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:10)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i did not.  we are waiting for ajit to submit some more jobs.  i also need to redo my config change, i forgot puppet overrides<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:30)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i'll mention it tho, thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:19)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> ok jobs are submitted.  i haven't looked at any logs yet but i see a couple of pilots are running for the cms itb frontend but so far nothing is reporting to the collector.  do you see any issues on the factory? (have not had a chance to check gwms version yet)<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:56)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @klarson1: Yes, it looks like we've got glideins successfully submitted to Stampede. However, recent logs show problem staging out files from frontend. Mon Jan 23 15:07:15 CST 2017 Failed to load file 'description.h1l026.cfg' from '<a href="http://vocms0802.cern.ch/vofrontend/stage">http://vocms0802.cern.ch/vofrontend/stage</a>'.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:12)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> P.S. I just checked CERN-ITB frontend (0802). It's running glideinWMS 3.2.16.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:19)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> was that err msg was version related?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:41)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i've seen it before but it was an issue related to a reconfig or something<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:48:33)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> No, the errors you reported last week (at the time) seemed to be version related since Edgar also saw them. But now that you don't, I'm not sure. This error here is simply the glidein cannot download a file from the frontend for some reason.<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:40)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> let me do some checking, i'm in the middle of something else so will get to it in a bit.  thanks for checking the logs!<br/>

<h3>Wed Mar 8, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:11:33)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @sthapa: Sorry, I forgot I owe you glideinwms 3.2.18 on GOC-INT factory. Will take care of that today.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:04)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> thanks, no rush on this.  the 3.2.18 fe works with a 3.2.16 factory so I was able to test the fe<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:34)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, cool. I just remembered after seeing the release testing ticket for 3.2.18. At the very least, I know they fixed the lock file bug we had in 3.2.17 factory.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(20:17:13)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @mkandes - where are we in the note to VO frontend admins about <tt>STARTD_JOB_ATTRS</tt>?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(22:24:37)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> If Edgar had no changes to suggest as frontend master, we can send out as originally written.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(22:25:03)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @bbockelm @efajardo<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(22:52:31)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @sthapa: GOC-INT factory has been upgraded to gldieinwms 3.2.18. I also rebuilt condor tarballs. Note, however, they are a fair bit on the old side .... condor 8.2.8. I'm not sure how much testing you do with this factory. But you may want to at least get one 8.4.x and 8.6.x versions on there at some point.<br/>

<h3>Wed May 17, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:33)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I just noticed that there arenâ€™t any glideins for the OSG_US_OSU_COWBOY site.  Is there an issue on the factory?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:21)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> So we have a good opportunity to impress the heck out of DUNE people this week during their collaboration meeting. I just opened a ticket for getting them added at FZU; there might be some more tickets for other sites depending on how things go. But if we could show them how quickly one can get a site up and running and how easy the OSG infrastructure makes it to get to sites, we could find ourselves with many new friends.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @marian @jdost321 @vaibhav2.g ^^^ DUNE is good friends to make.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(13:49:09)</span> <b>vaibhav2.g:</b></span> @bbockelm @kherner  DUNE added to FZU<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:49:45)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I saw it; thanks for the quick work. I've got test jobs in the queue now.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:07)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @vaibhav2.g And test job #1 has just finished; apparently successfully<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:06)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> 2:01 from initial ticket to completion of the first successful test job. Is that a record?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:54)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I grant you that it helped that FZU already had the infrastructure set up.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:40)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I apologize for being a pain, but could we get the FZU entry changed in production within the next 30 minutes? I'm giving a tutorial/best practices talk during their collab. meeting in half an hour, and this would be nice to spring on them (&lt; 4 hours from cold start to running in production)<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:06)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I'll make it up to you in beverages at our next meeting<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:25)</span> <b>vaibhav2.g:</b></span> @kherner we are on it...give us 10 mins<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:34)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:48)</span> <b>vaibhav2.g:</b></span> @kherner alright done!<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:27)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:38)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Many thanks @vaibhav2.g<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:21)</span> <b>vaibhav2.g:</b></span> @kherner Can you update/close the GOC ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:27)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yes, I'd like to make sure we get at least a few of the tests from the production frontend to complete (should be soon), and then I'll close it<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:46)</span> <b>vaibhav2.g:</b></span> sounds good<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:11:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @jdost321 @marian Just checking in to see that you are receiving my emails. Can you give me an answer on the 8.6.x question?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:20:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi @rynge ... there is difference, in the <tt>&lt;condor_tarballs&gt;</tt> part between ITB and production factory (at least I checked SDSC one) ... I don't see 8.6.x supported, however 8.6.3 is there ... does that help? (and sorry there is no immediate reply when you need, we try to balance load in Ops as we can for high prio issues so you have see delays ... especially these days since we've lost one operator at SDSC)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, 8.6.3 is the info I needed<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:00)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> cool!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:22:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> for the default as well as rhel7 8.6.3 is in on production factories<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @mkandes <a href="http://osg-flock.grid.iu.edu">osg-flock.grid.iu.edu</a> /DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=glideinwms/osg-flock.grid.iu.edu<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, Marian is out today. Let me have a look.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:31)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @rynge: Glideins submitted to the RHEL7 entires at Syracuse are landing on RHEL6 worker nodes, failing OS validation. I'll email them and see what's up.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> They did ask for help with the job router, so I'm not really surprised<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:01)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Also, are you sure the front-end is not submitting request to the GOC-ITB factory?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:31)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I haven't got that far yet, but I did see feosgflock glideins running at Syracuse.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:21)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, yeah, osg-flock is registered with GOC-ITB factory and appears to be passing requests without a problem.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The same FE is used for production and itb<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Really? I still get the error<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Really, what log is that error from?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:20:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Group err.log<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:21:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It might be just one entry it is complaining about<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:16)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Hmm. Is there a way to associate that error with a specific glidein request? I wonder if that's simply the Comet entry complaining because you have not given it an XSEDE project id<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:04)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> We recently added the OSGVO to the GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs list there. Edgar requested it. But you could be attempting to submit those RSV test jobs to the entry.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Probably it. Let me exclude that and see if the error goes away. Hang on<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:17)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yes, it was the Comet entry<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Excluding Comet made the warning/error go away<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:40)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, cool.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:17)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @rynge: When you get a chance, can you also come back around to <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32197">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32197</a>? I think all we need is some confirmation that your job filtering is working as expected and then we can probably close out ticket.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:43)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I don't think there's much we can do about this from the factory though.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:29)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Neither from OSG VO. We have verified that the filtering is working for us - but SBGrid might have another filter<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I will reply to the ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:29)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Ah, gotchya. Yeah, I forgot. sbgrid is a separate VO.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That cancercomputer thing is very fragile<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I bet we will break it again some time in the future<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:26)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hi, can we get the Utah entry re-enabled again? I'm interested in only the RHEL7 one<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> #osg-gfactory ping<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(20:00:09)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @rynge: Sorry, my wifi and then battery ran out on my flight. I'll reenable one of the RHEL7 entries on the GOC-ITB factory for testing.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(20:50:09)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @rynge: Actually, both the RHEL6 and RHEL7 entries are still enabled, but only on the GOC-ITB factory. Feel free to test away when ready.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(20:51:21)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> But, of course, let us know if you need us to enable them on the production factories to put some pressure on the filesystem.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(21:17:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @mkandes Yes, let's get the RHEL7 one enabled in production. I think we just had a black hole node so I need a lot of glideins going through to find it.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(21:18:02)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Also, it would be good if we could get the Syracuse RHEL7 enabled as well<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(21:39:59)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, you want one of the Syracuse one's in production too?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(22:10:26)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @rynge: Okay, RHEL7 entry at Utah is back in production. I'm going to hold off on entries at Syracuse until we hear back that they are ready. Looks like one CE still needs job route put in place.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(22:10:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks!!<br/>

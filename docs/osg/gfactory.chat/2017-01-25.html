<h3>Wed Jan 25, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes: I have to switch to do other work now so consider my Ops shift ended for glidein stuff … what would need more attention is Vanderbilt (see JIRA and GGUS) and I’d say we wanted to discuss with @kherner more in details why there is need disabling/enabling JINR_Tier2 entries on production factory, i.e. what doesn’t make debugging useful if it’s enabled already in ITB factory ...<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:36)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @marian It's an issue with our ITB frontend; it's not set up to do glexec.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, so you’re also testing then from production frontend which talks only to production factory?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:51)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Given some time I can probably get that changed but at the moment it was easier to do a quick enable/disable for testing. Though I completely understand if the repeated changes are getting tiresome by now.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:04)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yes, the ITB frontend talks to the ITB factory<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:08)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> and prod to prod<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I think we can for a moment register your production frontend on our ITB facgtory<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I wouldn’t see problem with that unless Marty has something against it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I guess it would be more useful … just a thought<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:46)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Could work but I'd want to chat with some people here first<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yep, agreed<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes: Marty, also pull latest confgis on GOC factory and CERN one too … I don’t thing there were too many changes but I did stuff only on SDSC … there were mostly things related to noncms so I ignored CERN factory for a moment<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:27:32)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Will do. @kherner: Let me take a look at the current state of the factory config for these entries and have a think about the best course of action is regarding on-going glexec testing.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:43)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @mkandes Actually it looks like this last round of fixes finally did the trick.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:05)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Cool. I'll double check what it looks like for us at our end too. Did you need any further changes while I look?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:02)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I'll update the ticket. For now, I don't think we need anything. Let's leave the JINR-Tier2 entries enabled in production so we can get more jobs on them and catch any other failure modes we haven't seen yet.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:06)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Hi @amjad. I thought it'd be good to have you join us here for any questions as you get ramped up. I know time differences are a problem. But you can post or message us any random questions you have here too.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:14)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> i.e., instead of email<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:34)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @kherner: Sounds good.<br/>

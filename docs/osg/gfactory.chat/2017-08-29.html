<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:43)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:27:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian what VO's pilots were you looking at that were failing at clemson? flightworthy had a look at the errors in the logs and they think it was an issue that was fixed in 8.6.5<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Ugh, tough question... maybe I have note of it in corresponding JIRA ticket, but I think it was feosgflock...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:02:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> 8.6.5 was deployed at SDSC two weeks ago and at Indiana one week ago... so if issue disappeared in this time frame it could be it...<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The glideins are still 8.6.3<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Do you have 8.6.5 available now?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:33)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I mean for the glidein tarball<br/>

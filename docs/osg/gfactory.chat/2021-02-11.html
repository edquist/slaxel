However, if "-o BatchMode=yes" is used by the ssh client it will cause a problem with our DUO/MFA exemption configuration and auth will fail.  The /etc/shadow password hash for the glowmon account is "!!" in /etc/shadow;  I don't think that will be a problem, but I could be wrong.  Give it a try and let me know if there is success or failure.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-Moate</pre><br/>

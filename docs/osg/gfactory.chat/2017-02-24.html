Thing is I can cover in principal, but got strong recommendation from physician I should not work for the rest of this week at all, only after I finish my antibiotics which is Sunday. So I have officially sick leave Friday included. I can help at least watching things coming in and maybe ping Jeff take a look? Though, I'm pretty sleepy on these pills from prescription so I also enjoy infrequent naps during daylight :)<br/>

If is busy too, I can still monitor any urgent needs that come up. I'm just going to try and focus on one other project tomorrow as much as possible.<br/>

<h3>Wed Jan 4, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:14)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> are we meeting today?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(09:31:39)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I was waiting for Jeff to show. Did you all want to chat? I'm catching up on emails. I can ping Marian though if there is something to discuss. I know we need to do the GPGrid changes I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi, wasn't connected to Slack so sent email instead... Now I'm here<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm also not sure whether there is much to talk unless Jeff can update us how was Ops over XMas break...<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:13)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> ./opt/factools/libexec/mail_report.sh<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:09)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> cd /opt/glideinwms/factory/tools/analyze_entries<br/>/usr/bin/analyze_entries<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:14:34)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> <a href="https://github.com/jdost321/factools">https://github.com/jdost321/factools</a><br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:37)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> cd /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/glideinwms/lib/<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:53)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> cd /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/glideinwms/tools/<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:06)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> from glideinwms.lib import xmlParse<br/>from glideinwms.factory.tools.lib import analyze<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:29)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm bit confused what Andrei would like to achieve: <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32249">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32249</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> should it be registered Frontend to submit to the Factory ... and it seems it is DIRAC in his case ... do we support any Dirac FE submit to OSG factories?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I don't see anything like DIRAC mapped on the condor level in 90_gwms_dns.config which would tell whether they can submit to factory or not ... that's why I think his question is not really to Factory Ops ... what others think?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:07)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Is DIRAC the VO? If so, I'm guessing that would be one of the VOs under Fermilab. Maybe add Ken Herner onto th ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:10)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> *the<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> DIRAC is experiment, but not sure if separate VO<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:58)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yeah, I bet it is one of the experiments under the Fermilab VO. This looks like a Fermilab VO user problem, not a factory operations issue. It looks like the user was trying to directly submit to the CE ... not via glideins.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> user should use FE submit jobs to the CEs via Factory ... not sure what Andrei is doing in this case as he clearly tries -remote submits to FNAL and in second attempt to UCSD<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that make more sense to me now<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:20)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> will CC Ken ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> should I cc then <a href="mailto:fermigrid-help@fnal.gov">fermigrid-help@fnal.gov</a> on the ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> will do Ken fermigrid-help :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Ken &amp; fermigrid<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:12)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> That sounds good.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so Joe and Ken don't know anything about dirac in question ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> commented back and removed Ken and fermigrid from cc<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:28)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Sorry I missed this being discussed here. DIRAC is indeed not a Fermilab VO subgroup<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:39)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> at least not at this point<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:47)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> FNAL probably came in because they were trying to do a direct submit to the CMS Tier1<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:05)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: Are you done with Factory Ops for the day?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:35)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> if i understand correctly DIRAC is a pilot system I think originally for the LHCb experiment<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:52)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> enmr is a european VOthat is trying to use it to submit to OSG sites<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:32)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> so really glideinwms isn't even in the picture, its more of an issue of sites not supporitng the enmr VO<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes: yes, I'm done with Ops for today<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @jdost321: so we need to reassign them to other support unit completelly<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:14)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, cool. Thanks. I'just getting started.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:17)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, DIRAC is LHCb<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:28)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> i'm going to email rob quick again off list to see what he wants to do<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:54)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I will ignore this DRIAC ticket then.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and now I recall they have indeed own system to submit jobs ... but I have no clue about any details but obviously they need to talk to other people than us probably<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sounds like good idea Jeff ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> first of I thought then want to get into entry point with their CE or something like that ... the subject is unclear saying "New OSG site - problems" so it's confusing why Rob sent them to us<br/>

<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:29)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> It seems FNAL's plan to move to 16384MB glideins has not borne as much fruit as we had hoped<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(09:46:19)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Due to some slightly oddly-sized machines, when we go to 16384 MB glideins we end up not being able to fit the last glidein on the node, relative to what we had with 16000MB glideins. Our current thinking is to go back to 16000 in the immediate term, and then change to a slightly smaller size, but advertise 16884. What we would like to happen is for the glidein to only be killed when it goes over 16384 MB of memory usage as opposed to when it exceeds the actual physical allocation (the optimum seems to be 15940 MB based on our node sizes.) I assume this is not difficult to do (kill when the usage exceeds the advertised size as opposed to the physical size)?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:12)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @kherner, this kind of functionality is not usually managed at factory-level. Typically, sites are responsible for setting up their preemption requirements. You may also be able to do it from frontend, but I don't know. If this is necessary to do from factory though, we can look into if this is possible.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:42)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @mkandes Right, we can take of that on the FNAL side; I just wanted to be sure everyone was on the same page, and that there weren't any issues that I hadn't thought of earlier. Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:56)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Hi quick question, is the glidein-int factory at the same version of the glidein software as the production factories?<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:57)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @sthapa, the production factories are using condor 8.4.9 and glideinwms 3.2.16.<br/>

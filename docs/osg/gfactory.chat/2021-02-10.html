<h3>Wed Feb 10, 2021 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:22)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 - is it possible to access the factory logs?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Particularly, there are some suspicious pilot startup failures in the CHTC frontend I'd like to better understand.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:52)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (alternately, @marian might know this)<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:14)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> we don't have one public place people can retrieve them from, but on request we've set up rsync of logs to hosts for some frontends, i don't recall doing this for glow however<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:40)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> do you have a particular site / entry we can just get some logs to you from around a certain date / time?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:20)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> looks like we did attempt at one time to rsync logs to a server for glow, to <a href="http://monitor.chtc.wisc.edu">monitor.chtc.wisc.edu</a><br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:26)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> but its commentd out<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> did we stop sending logs to gracc es? Kibana might give a lot what Brian wants if so ... I remember we had some mechanism for it through Logstash, but maybe it was only prototype and never ended in production...<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:50)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> the logstash or whatever it was running on the factory was too i/o intensive so we stopped it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:00)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I see<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:17)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> longer term plan was to rsync to an external host then logstash from there, on edgar's todo but it was always low prio relative to other things, never happened<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:03)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I'm fine with the rsync approach again.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:33:22)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @moate - what's the best replacement for monitor these days?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:08)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 - another thing looking at logs is that the GLOW-ITB frontend needs to coordinate a DN change, seems to be one reason it's not working.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Are Let's Encrypt DNs kosher for this?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:27)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I feel like in theory Let's Encrypt should work for FE -&gt; Factory communication but I don't believe we've tried it<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ok, I'll open a ticket with the details so we have a paper trail.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:37)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> Thanks, @marian can we assign this to you?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:40)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66783">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66783</a> here we go.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Reassigned to Marian as I think he's on triage.<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:31)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> @bbockelm is this an rsync push (factory to CHTC) or an rsync pull (CHTC to factory)?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:50)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> push, via ssh<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:23)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> Gottcha;  perhaps use <tt><a href="http://glidein-cm3000.chtc.wisc.edu">glidein-cm3000.chtc.wisc.edu</a></tt> then, since it's GWMS-related?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:19)</span> <b>moate:</b></span> There's no full-on replacement for <tt><a href="http://monitor.chtc.wisc.edu">monitor.chtc.wisc.edu</a></tt>, we're moving its various functions to other servers<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:16:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> just fyi - ticket <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66783">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66783</a> updated<br/>

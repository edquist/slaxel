<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:14)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> anyone on ops now?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:37)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i wanted to follow up on steve timm's email with the subject "Strange group of glideins with wrong proxy"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I saw that one!<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:32)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @klarson1: I am suppose to be. But I'm at home not feeling super well today. I hope to at least try to catch up a bit sometime today, especially after ignoring tickets most of the week due to the AHM. Did you have something specific about "wrong proxy" request? I do vaguely remember seeing it yesterday and think that was odd.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Sounds like a problem CERN had. How is the factory hashing gridmanager processes?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:42)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> @bbockelm that was exactly the line of reasoning we were headed down<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> You need to have a unique grid manager per credential otherwise the security session would get reused<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:43)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> And IIRC there's one per user (frontend) now<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:30)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> not sure it's the same this time.  If I understand correctly from Steve, the FE admins actually changed the role temporarily in a pilot proxy, then reverted it back.  so I guess it was just human error?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:48)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> not exactly<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:00)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> they changed their frontend group configurations from one valid version to another<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:28)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> so there was two proxies from two different groups that went to the gpce02 entry<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:35)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> then after the frontend change there was only one<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:50)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> they use the same security configuration/user on the factory<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:06)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> we think gwms behaved but condor got confused?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:45)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> so the solution might be change the security mappings for groups to be different if proxies can somehow be shared?  or something to keep the credentials separate?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:31)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> i don't know the cern situation, just working with steve on guesses why we had what happened with the fife frontend and the sdsc factory.  it was brief and only one factory.<br/>

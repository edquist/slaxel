<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:43)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> RE: <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32520">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32520</a> I've got a mail in to some LSST folks to try to better understand what exactly they're looking for<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:47)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @kherner: Thanks. Let us know what you hear.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:30)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Well that must have set some kind of record for a response time:<br/>"""<br/>Hi Ken,<br/><br/> From the DESC perspective, our early GRID use is expected to be in the UK. Hence our need for a VO to associate with. The UK is offering us 2M CPU-hrs this year, increasing to 10 next year.<br/><br/> Our expectation is to use ATLASâ€™ PanDA tools to interface our workflow tools to the GRID.<br/>"""<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:21)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> The LSST VO already exists and seems to be the natural choice. As far as interfacing with UK sites, I was marginally involved getting some UK sites set up to support the FIFE frontend for Microboone, but that was all with gWMS and no PanDA<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:15)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Well, if they are going to use PanDA, then we're the wrong people for them to be talking to. Do you know who they should contact?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:38)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Well then I got another reply just now. Basically there are two entities at work: there's LSST and then there's DESC (Dark Energy Science Collaboration or some such.) At this point the two groups do not appear to have converged on common toolsets. So they PanDA reply was dealing with DESC as you can see. Then this second email says there are Purdue people running LSST sims, so they may not be doing things the same way.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:50)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Plus they have a new Data Management head coming on board soon. So I think I need to put my Production Support hat on and make sure we flesh out who all of the constituents are and how they all fit together.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:28)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> So now I'm wondering if DESC is kind of wanting their own VO or something. Anyway, it's clear I need to keep talking to them and figure out who's doing what.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:17)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Ah, gotchya. Well, if there's anything we can do to help. Just let us know.<br/>

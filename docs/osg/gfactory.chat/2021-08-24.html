<h3>Tue Aug 24, 2021 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:48)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Can you update to 3.7.5 once it's released? Might be a few weeks; Marco said he'll have a release candidate out today.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:42:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marcom and @dbox have RCs in osg-development already. Which RC should we be using?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(08:48:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> for the production factory? IMO wait until we have a release in upcoming-release<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:55:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> sure -- confused why you brought up the RC then<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:05:10)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> just to suggest a timeline<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> if xrootd has taught me anything, an RC doesn't have any bearing on timeline :)<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:38)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @matyas sure sounds good. I can update ITB sooner to the RC if you want to test sooner<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:16)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @rynge 9.1.x now points to 9.1.3 on itb. I will work on getting that and 9.0.4 into the prod factory<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:22)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> actually 9.0.5 looks like the latest stable, so that's what I updated to.<br/>

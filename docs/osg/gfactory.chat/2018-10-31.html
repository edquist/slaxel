<h3>Wed Oct 31, 2018 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:37)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> What is the timeline for 3.4.1?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Is it deployed on ITB already?<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:21)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> it was just updated on the itb at cern but marco will have to comment on the testing of it.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Cool, I sent email to the glideinwms list as well. My main question here is when production factories are scheduled for the upgrade.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I think that needs comment from @jdost321... I guess he still out sick today<br/>
<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:33)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> if testing goes well i would guess within a few weeks<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:00)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok, I need some pointers on the current ITB setup. My config still has <a href="http://glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu">glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu</a>, which is obviously not correct anymore<br/>

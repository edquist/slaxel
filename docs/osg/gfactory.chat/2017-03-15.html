<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:57)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Interesting about the UCD entry - you would think squid would be the easy service to maintain<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:19)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yeah, having configured every piece of an OSG site software in last week or two, I would say that is the easiest.<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @marian Looks like the itb glideins eventually worked on clemson. I don't have logs from the glideins, but my jobs seem to have run fine.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> good news! I haven't checked back if new tarball was picked, though<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:43)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> CondorVersion = "$CondorVersion: 8.6.5 Aug 01 2017 BuildID: 411560 $"<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So I think we are good to try that tarball out in production<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:31:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @rynge: yeah, I also checked one of the glidein logs and can confirm I see it picks <tt>CONDOR_PLATFORM_8.6.5-default-default 1</tt> ... but there are also validation issues for some glideins running rhel6 on rhel7, error is <tt>Validation failed in main/test_os.sh.</tt> ... <tt>Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.3 (Maipo)<br/>Failed OS test for rhel6</tt> ... is there perhaps intermix of nodes at Clemson on particular entry(entries)? I think we need to report this as separate issue, though...<br/>

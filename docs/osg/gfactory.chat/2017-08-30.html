<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @rynge: correct, glideins are still 8.6.3, we don't ship 8.6.5 glidein tarball yet<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:00)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So a 8.6.5 tarball would probably be the fix for Clemson, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> we could make 8.6.5 tarball and put into ITB Factory see the effect<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> was between 8.6.3 and 8.6.5 anything significant (sorry for my ignorance, don't remember details right now about Clemson issue)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Well, I just looked at the Clemson issue, and Brian Lin says it is fixed in 8.6.5 - that is all I know<br/>

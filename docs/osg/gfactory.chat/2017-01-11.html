<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:17)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @klarson1, I'll wait to hear from you if and when any decisions are made with @kherner about what changes to the GPGrid entries need to be made. If you can make then on the FNAL factory and then push to GitHub, I'll pull changes into GOC and SDSC factories. Just let me know.<br/>

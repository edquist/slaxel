<h3>Fri Apr 21, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(00:19:05)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes @rynge: guys, will push the entry to production first thing in the morning, just don’t want to risk something unexpectly blows up on the factory during reconfig at this late hour … Murphy is watching!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes @rynge: OS_US_XSEDE_Jetstream in production<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:41)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey, if a site is marked as being unavailable due to downtime, it's the factories that are responsible for not sending pilots to that site, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:49:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Great! I see one node from Jetstream and jobs seem to work well<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @blin: well, we don't usually bother put such site in downtime on the Factory side ... we just let glideins fail until site is back ... we usually check if site is in downtime when we see some errors, if it's the case we either ignore or put site in downtime on Factory end, too ... so we sort of relax on that ... why?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> this ticket: <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/33539">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/33539</a> bob's annoyed that they're still getting pilots<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> particularly from glow<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, I can set them in downtime ... thing is we don't have sync with OIM when site is in downtime ... we have scripts which generates downtime info for us, but it's us go through list every time and set site into downtime in the factories ... if they are getting jobs, are they really in downtime? if they have things off nothing will start there ... I can put them in downtime here if needed<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> if it bothers them<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> what are the CEs in question actually?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:30:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> or OIM link that I can check ...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:38)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> uhhh<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think it's this one <a href="http://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=250">http://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=250</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe others though<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> <a href="http://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=547">http://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=547</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, I try to get there eventually in next hour or so<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and figure what entries need to go to downtime<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:57)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> doing bit of packacking stuff now, finally<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> actually, we have them in downtime! 2017-04-19T19:55:00+00:00 2017-04-24T21:00:00+00:00 HCC_US_Michigan_gate02 All All # _ad_ Gatekeeper is broken.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:24)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @marian @blin factories automatically put entries in downtime, which stops submission, but don't automatically clear the pilots.  I replied to the Michigan ticket.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> wow, do they?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> cool, thanks guys<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I did reply too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that all is set and I cleaned pilots<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:33)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> yes, we have had this script for years<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:42)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> the _ad_ in the comment means it was an auto downtime<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> aaah, that I couldn't decipher who is it "ad"<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sorry I didn't know about the script, now I know<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @jdost321 Can you create that <tt>AMNH-HEL</tt> ITB entry? I have a ticket with the site which has been opened since February, with an issue which was supposed to be fixed in 3.7.3. We still can't get it to work and need this entry for further debugging. Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:25)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @rynge sorry I've been dealing with a backlog of my own, I thought @jpeterson converted HEL to a non-covid CE? or at to least updated it to accept regular jobs there?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:58)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> sorry not clear to me if its just some updates on the entry or if we need to also fix some CE job rout stuff without looking<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:46)</span> <b>jpeterson:</b></span> The production one was quick hacked to accept not just COVID jobs, sounds like you need the same hacks done to ITB for testing?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Just need the production entry on itb<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:26)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre>FactoryType == "OSG-ITB" &amp;&amp; stringListMember("OSGVO", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)</pre><br/><br/>

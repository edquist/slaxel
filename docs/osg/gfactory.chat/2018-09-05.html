<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I don't recall why that, but should come from some naming convention we have for similar entries ... is there any issue with it or is it just question out of curiousity, @ian_cancercomputer?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:22)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Just curiosity from my perspective.  Though I could see it also going against OSG policy too maybe.  On the whole I don’t much care what CancerComputer’s metadata says as long as the rest of OSG is OK with it.<br/>

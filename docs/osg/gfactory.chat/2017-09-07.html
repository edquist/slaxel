<span style="color: #e7392d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:05)</span> <b>klarson1:</b></span> @jdost321 @marian will one of you guys be around today for me to add our new fermilab production frontends to the OSG production factories?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian @rynge did we get the 8.6.5 tarball onto the ITB factory to see if it performed any better?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I haven't heard anything<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:27)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But would love to get this resolved<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> agreed, @marian @jdost321 @efajardo what would it take to get this done?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm out today, had surgical procedure at dentist this morning. I thought I will be back at work this afternoon, but... I take the pain and relax home for the rest of the day .... and, it was my shift this afternoon ... I am back tomorrow fully operational I believe and will catch up with things for you guys unless Jeff will find the time create tarball on the itb in the meantime<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:18)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> <b>@channel</b> @dweitzel and myself think we are ready to move the log stasher to production. Could you install filebeats meanwhile:<br/><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/5.5/setup-repositories.html">https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/5.5/setup-repositories.html</a><br/><br/>in the production factories please? We are happy on how it is running on ITB<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:09)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @marian We are now getting slots from CDF_FR_CCIN2P3. Thank you!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:14)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> However, we only get 5<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Can you see if you have limits set in the factory config?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> excellent!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'll take a quick look<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> no limits, it's pretty wide open, up to 5000 running which is default<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> there is feligo idle stuff, though ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> besides osgflock<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and bunch of feligo running<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:57)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that could be current limit<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:21)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It is suspicious that it is 5 so constantly. Xenon supposedly have an allocation as well, but I will push it back to them. Thanks for setting this up!<br/>

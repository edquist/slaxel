<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> good question, @dweitzel! I don't think it knows unless Frontend does that check via script that is checking it. Still, it's a guess, I may be wrong about it.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> So it's not set in the factory config the Disk per slot?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> at least there is nothing like that per entry (CE resource) settings in the entries configs anywhere ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:44:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> in the global settings which apply to all entries there is MIN_DISK_GBS=1 ... whatever that means ... but nothing anywhere for MAX_DISK_GBS (if that is supported, I havent' checked)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> it could be still burned in the startup or validation pilot script, though, but that is not really configurable thing rather than something to change in the scripts ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:46:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> we could ask Marco Mambelli while he is on the OSG Technology call right now<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> do you want it for some specific entry if it's supported, @dweitzel?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'm curious on how the per slot disk works for Red at UNL<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, so fair question to ask Marco unless Jeff has better answer here<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> There is some magic inside gwms for this<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <a href="https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/blob/master/creation/web_base/condor_startup.sh">https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/blob/master/creation/web_base/condor_startup.sh</a><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Not easy to understand all the cases<br/>

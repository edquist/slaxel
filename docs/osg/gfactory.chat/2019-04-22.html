<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:47:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @jthiltges there were some questions about how sites can support whole node glideins -- for a condor site, do they need to enable dynamic slots?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:31)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> yes - well, actually partitionable slots<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, ok<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I guess that there might be a way to do this with static slots, if those are the only slots that exist at your site.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:35)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> It'd be trailblazing - potential for some of the requirement expressions to need tweaking.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> eh, syracuse is just interested in doing partitionable slots and factory ops mentioned whole node and it wasn't completely clear if the partitionable slots was a requirement or not<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:39)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Was distracted for a bit. Hopefully the question is answered above. If not, please let me know how I can help.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:52:37)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I haven't done whole nodes for a while, so my understanding here is rusty. Note that the site has a mix of different worker nodes, so there is no way to express the number of cores/memory a job has to claim to get a whole node<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:02)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I guess it can be done with dynamic slots, and binding the job to slot1<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But is that still how it is done?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:55:38)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre><br/>OrangeGrid – these are scavenged desktops – ~15K cores at peak overnight. (kicks on @ 5PM and turns off @ 7 AM when someone is logged in, if no one is logged in, it can run 24x7)<br/><br/>Core counts: 2,4,8 cores<br/><br/>Memory per node: 1-4 GB<br/><br/> <br/><br/>CRUSH – virtualized compute farm – typically shifts between 4K and as high as 20K cores<br/><br/>Core counts: 24,40,64 (24 core nodes are slated for decommissioning this summer)<br/><br/>Memory per node: 2-4 GB<br/></pre><br/>

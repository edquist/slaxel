<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:16:34)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 - for the factory, I've figured out what precisely is the minimum number of patches to get IDTOKENS working:<br/>• <a href="https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/commit/27e3e39529171b99c78a84ac9b8c5d7a9740c39f">https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/commit/27e3e39529171b99c78a84ac9b8c5d7a9740c39f</a> (all of this commit)<br/>• <a href="https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/commit/1d0e55f5dbaa7886ec2dd8b98f1d9f129faca1f5#diff-230519d79b5c8722344e8fb7a9aab40f3b09070c923d31b7d97b69f8938d0beaR1220">https://github.com/glideinWMS/glideinwms/commit/1d0e55f5dbaa7886ec2dd8b98f1d9f129faca1f5#diff-230519d79b5c8722344e8fb[…]23d31b7d97b69f8938d0beaR1220</a> (just this one change)<br/>Let's talk about it on Monday.  I found at least one IDTOKENS bug in 3.7.3-rc1 (but it's frontend only) so that might be a good one for the ITB factory.<br/>

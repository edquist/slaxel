<h3>Tue May 16, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:27)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @bbockelm @marian please see my replies<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:06)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Sounds good.  I'll have John changes in the PR and setup a smooth transition here.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:38)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> thanks, when John confirms he has both we'll try the new name in the factory config<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:46)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yup, I'll ask him to bump the thread once it's ready on the CE side.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:52)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Did we make any progress on the CMS frontend?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:48)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @marian i understand the urgency of fixing it but I think a better solution last night would have been to just put the entries in temporary downtime and clear the pilots until we agreed on a solution<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:15)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I haven't poked the FE admins, I assumed you would, I can bring it up on tomorrow's CMS infrastructure call<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:25)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> hmm that's not till thurs, i guess i can send Diego an email<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I haven't gotten the chance - FKW threw a bunch of work at me last night :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:59)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> heh, fair enough, i'll shoot our CMS friends an email<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @jdost321: no offense, but if downtime was action preferred instead you two would have done it right after email we sent around what's the problem... thought I just help take an action I did...<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:46)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I wasn't aware it was causing real issues until this morning when I saw your email citing the GOC ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Ok, so don't blame me either please ;)<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:40)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> i'm just suggesting if there's a policy change, like changing an attribute that depends on us all agreeing on the value as a team, maybe its better to just put the entry in downtime until we agree on the solution<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:07)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> just suggesting that  in case something like this comes up in the future<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I stop talking here, sorry<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:40)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> @rynge I get this error: "An error occurred: Allocation uoa113 does not belong to the cluster" Did blake<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:48)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> followed the procedure in the XSEDE portal that I mentioned?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I will double check<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:27)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah the users is listed as part of the allocation<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Is there something special to enable virtual cluster access?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:29)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:59)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Or nothing else should be needed<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:11)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Let me double check<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (for those following on the channel, it seems that <tt>auto</tt>-based pilots don't work on the CMS frontend due to a workaround put in place last year for a particularly nasty gfactory bug ... but the workaround was never removed afterward.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (ah - before I context-switch back, it seems John fixed the CE side and Nebraska is ready for @jdost321 's change for whole nodes to go into production)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(17:36:59)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> @rynge I see the new allocation working and consuming good CPI<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(17:37:00)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> CPU<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(06:40:12)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I don't know who was on shift yesterday, but I saw at least two gfactory folks at FNAL... you might be able to find them in person today.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner... I was looking at this, but along other things I had broken access to the common factory git repo ... that's pretty much unfortunate for ops, though ... I had made couple of more changes which are waiting to be deployed to other entries, too ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and, now I've sucessfuly pushed changes in ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner... did you want just clone <tt>gridce0</tt> with support <tt>GM2</tt> and change CEs to <tt>grid{1,2,3,4}</tt> CEs for the cloned entries? did I get it right? assuming that all is working for the <tt>grid0</tt> I can do that without additional round of tests ....<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:51)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> yes, they are all supposedly the same now<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, I will clone those now and put them in production ... if there is anything going on we'll debug live<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> but since grid0 and all other should be identical I'll go ahead and do it<br/>

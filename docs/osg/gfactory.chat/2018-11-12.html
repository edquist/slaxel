<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:41)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Hi all, sorry to be a pain, but FNAL would greatly appreciate prompt action on <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/7970">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/7970</a><br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:32)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> We seem to have shot ourselves in the foot. We've deployed a fix but would appreciate having idle pilots cleared out. No sense running something that is just going to fail.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:27)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I can have a look, @kherner <br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> So everything requested from gfrontend01? Do you recall supported VO names? Also, did you submit new jobs after fix on FE side? I would try to not remove also those if new glidens were requested already...<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:33)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Actually, we're seeing the job counts climb, so that means the fixed glideins must already be starting to hit the CEs.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:50)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Probably best to leave it alone then, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:37:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, OK, so I think let's leave things ... the old request will expire at some point<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:41:14)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> OK<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:41:19)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Feel free to close the ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:41:27)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Actually, one moment<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:49:18)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Let's remove both running and held from gpfrontend01 for these entries:<br/><br/>CDF_FR_CCIN2P3_cccreamceli09_long<br/>CDF_FR_CCIN2P3_cccreamceli10_long<br/>DUNE_T2_UK_London_IC_ceprod07_long<br/>DUNE_T2_UK_London_IC_ceprod08_long<br/><br/>They seem to be leftovers.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:52:15)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> And let's not touch any others.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:52:18)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(19:05:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> OK, @kherner, I made major clean up for those entries only and for that FE in question. Hope it helps, I also commented on the ticket.<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:29)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mkandes @jdost321 @klarson1 @amjad: Brian sent us special request called "hot potato" so that all you know I'm using ITB Factory where I set CMS_T2_US_Nebraska_Red-hotpotato entry point ... it's under 10-testonly-itb.xml ... so that you all know<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:48)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Okay, thanks for the heads up.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> also, they require GLIDEIN_REQUIRED_OS ... for rhel7 attribute in<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:32:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I guess we need to create tarball and set in glideinWMS.xml rhel7 flavor?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> nevermind, I see we have /var/lib/gwms-factory/condor/gfactory-3.2.16-1-condor-8.4.11-x86_64_RedHat7-stripped.tar.gz on GOC ITB folder<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> but we dont' have it in glideinWMS.xml ... so I'll add it and set os="rhel7"<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:26)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> @marian: FYI - GLIDEIN_REQUIRED_OS should be set to the underlying OS of the compute nodes. However, you don't have to run RHEL7 HTCondor tarballs on them ... unless that's what you want to test. For example, we currently only send RHEL6 tarballs for glideins in production .... regardless of underlying GLIDEIN_REQUIRED_OS.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I heard in emails they want specifically set GLIDEIN_REQUIRED_OS ... but maybe I misunderstood that part ... let's see how it goes ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that should run explicitelly on rhel7 DockerImage<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:43:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so maybe that's really how they want it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:19)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I was also adding DockerImage attribute to the entry point<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> maybe if you have time you can review what I did if it makes sense<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:45:19)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> it's on GOC ITB in 10-testonly-itb.xml<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:50)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> Yeah, I think it looks fine. The question is just whether or not they actually want RHEL7 tarballs too. But it looks like you made it available for 8.4.11.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:34)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> I'm not entirely sure how that choice gets resolved between factory and frontend settings.<br/>
<span style="color: #bd9336"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:49)</span> <b>mkandes:</b></span> It's usually up to frontend thoughI think.<br/>

<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:39)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Hi @marcom we're trying to get Singularity working on Stampede2 for OSG jobs. Problem is, Stampede2 has too old of a kernel for the cvmfsexec command. We can use mountrepo to mount CVMFS in some other directory but I'm not sure how to tell that to the pilot setup scripts<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:19)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> (We don't know up front what the path will be; we modified our script to look in $CVMFS_BASE which is set in the submit script)<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> We tried overriding HAS_SINGULARITY in our node validation script by adding <tt>HAS_SINGULARITY True</tt> to the glidein config, but that just ended with the pilot having<br/><pre>HAS_SINGULARITY False<br/>True</pre><br/><br/>

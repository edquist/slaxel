<h3>Thu Mar 7, 2019 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Was HTCondor 8.8.1 added to the factories? ITB as well? What is the identifier I need in the frontend?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:46:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I believe all you need is: version="8.8.1,8.8.x"<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not sure if this is in ITB factory, though ... in production factories it's in<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Seems like I can get 8.8.1 glidiens from ITB, but jobs are not working on them. Any chance I could get login access to the itb factory machine to see what the glidein logs says?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(21:55:35)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> grant you access that's question to @jdost321... ^<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(22:47:05)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Alternatively you can rsync to somewhere I can get to (as we do from prod factory to xd-login), or tell me why the recent glideins I had did not run jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(23:52:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> did you submit to specific entry and from which FE? I may have a look tomorrow, I have a factory shift on Friday... ping me then, please.<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi @kherner... Working on new DUNE entries: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/helpdesk/tickets/6837">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/helpdesk/tickets/6837</a> ... Can you tell what SE hostname to use for the entries?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:54)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> SE as in storage element?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:11)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> That's not quite ready yet, at least at Liverpool.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> hmm, we usually set it as GLIDEIN_SEs attribute for each entry we create<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm not sure if it's required, I can try create entry without that attribute for now and make a note for ourselves to add it later<br/>

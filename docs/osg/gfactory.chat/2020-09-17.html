<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hey @jdost321 we have this in our documentation:<br/>&gt;  After successfully running all the pilot jobs that are submitted by the test factory and verifying your site reports, your site will be deemed production ready. No action is required on your end, factory operations will start submitting pilot jobs from the production factory.<br/>is that actually true? don't we normally run it by the site that we're going to dump production jobs on them?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:16)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> I agree that is not worded well. we need to communicate to the site that our initial tests were successful, and we only move it to prod when they give us the go-ahead<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:58)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ok i'll fix it<br/>

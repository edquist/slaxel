<h3>Tue Nov 14, 2017 : #gfactory (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:23:57)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Quick question for those in the know on <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/35110">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/35110</a>: the idea is to run Nova jobs here in SL6 Singularity containers on the SL7 cluster. Does there need to be a factory entry that has GLIDEIN_REQUIRED_OS set to rhel6 to get that to work? The only ITB factory entry now has it set to rhel7.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:26)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Standard Nova production jobs ask for SL6/rhel6 in the job requirements.<br/>

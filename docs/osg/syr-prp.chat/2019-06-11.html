<span style="color: #8f4a2b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:01)</span> <b>dabrown:</b></span> @isfiligoi I talked to Mats last week to get us the release of condor that we need, but I'm on vacation most of this week as my kid's summer camp doesn't start until Monday. Will get back to it next week.<br/>

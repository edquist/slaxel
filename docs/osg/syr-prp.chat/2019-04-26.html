<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(09:16:27)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Basically I had to add the osg-flock DN to the grid map file of Duncan’s schedd<br/>

Even using stashcp seems to fail. @dabrown should this kind of transfer work in this case? I think for the pp tests we can find a way to avoid transferring any PSD files if we need to<br/>

<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:17)</span> <b>dfinstad:</b></span> When using stascp one error I see is<br/><pre><br/>Error from slot1_1@glidein_109012_232366610@osg-wn-sugwg-opt-5cc587c96c-7m6gl: STARTER at 10.244.79.38 failed to receive file /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_109008/glide_nlwJdc/<br/>execute/dir_119656/aLIGO_design.txt: FILETRANSFER:1:non-zero exit (512) from /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_109008/glide_nlwJdc/stashcp_plugin.<br/></pre><br/>which is maybe not the most useful, so I’ll see if I can find any other logs of what’s happening<br/>

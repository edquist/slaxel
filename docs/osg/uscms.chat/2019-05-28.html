<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:21)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @bockjoo - just read your USCMS Tier-2 update (sorry, will need to leave the call before your update).  If we still have to wait a bit for the rest of the IO servers to get xattr mounted, is it possible to export only the working server for the PhEDEx Debug instance?.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:39)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Unfortunately, I can not mount the lustre with xattr option anymore. We are waiting to add another OSS and our RC wants to wait until then.<br/>

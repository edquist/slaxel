<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:40)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> @andrew.melo @dmason 2 items remaining on my list for some months from previous us-cms tier2 meetings:<br/>1. CPU2017/HS06/etc benchmarking - any news on this? (you know my opinion :smile: It should be industry standard and no home brew tools - so seems only CPU2017 is the way)<br/>2. CentOS 8 - Are there any news what experiment/fnal decided to move forward? Or still evaluating all options?<br/>If there are not status on this, I will ping you after a month, and so on :D<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:38)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> For (1), unfortunately it looks like WLCG is going to HEPScore, which isn't industry standard. But on the upside, it's not licensed software, so we will have a USB stick that a vendor can boot from and run the tests for us. Dave's been dealing with a fire this week, but I think that he will have a HS06 container shortly, and the goal is that we all re-benchmark with this one "golden" version of HS06 to make sure it's apples-apples<br/><br/>For (2), I don't know what theplan is long term yet, but FNAL will be at least temporarily moving to C8-stream since the "legacy" C8 becomes EOL at the end of the year. I don't know if dave has some more inside info that I'm not privvy to<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:18)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> (1) - disappointing. I doubt any vendor will run that (HEPScore). You can get CPU2017 from them, but asking to rerun same on all possible CPUs -  answer is clear… We remain blind what we get for $ until we have hardware on hands.<br/>For container - Site’s still need to have SPEC2006 (tarball, iso). afaik - it is not allowed to share between institutions (I asked this at some point spec suite, so we wanted to run on another cluster, but maybe this. has changed). Also - why not this: <a href="https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks/hep-benchmark-suite">https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks/hep-benchmark-suite</a> ? And get all 3 numbers (hs06, cpu2017, hepscore)<br/>

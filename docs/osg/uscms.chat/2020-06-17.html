<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:59)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> I think we mentioned in passing during one of our T2 meetings, but I havenâ€™t had any luck tracking down a cause.  We have been noticing instances of CMS jobs coming in to our CE and somehow bypassing blahp submit attributes for slurm.  I have not noticed a pattern of when it happens, and looking at the job with <tt>condor_ce_q -l &lt;job number&gt;</tt> appears to be normal.  However in the slurm queue, the job has submitted with default settings which gives it one core and 2gb ram, the wrong partition and wrong walltime. The jobs DO appear to end during the standard 48hr time that they are supposed to come with.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:39)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> has anyone else run into this, or have any ideas of what to look for?<br/>

<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:04)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Not from my side. We are not running it load balanced. Xcache redirector between UCSD/Caltech is not auth and only dataservers are.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:22)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Well, you still have to have a host certificate, right/<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:29)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> At Nebraska, we do still have a SAN for our balanced address <a href="http://red-gridftp.unl.edu">red-gridftp.unl.edu</a> on all the certs. I don’t recall if xrootd ever got patched/fixed/tweaked such that it isn’t necessary anymore however.<br/><br/>I believe we tried a single certificate with all our actual real servers listed as SANs instead, but that either 1) broke xrootd or 2) we were just lazy and never actually put it in production.<br/><br/>We get our InCommon-IGTF certs for “free” so we haven’t put thought or effort into it recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:44)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Well, I get mine from UW now, so I guess I can just re-do the redirector certs with a SAN and see if it works for xrootd-HTTP<br/>

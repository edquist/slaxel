<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:28)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> @justas.balcas any movement on the IPv6 LHCONE peering issue above? Or is that going to magically go away with your “move to our own IPv6 range” you mention in the site report?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:26)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> That is correct. IPv6 range we have is from CENIC block and there was previously endless discussions with CENIC and ESNet about this. Simplest solution is to move to our own range and do what we want<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:02)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> So by Friday we should be good<br/>

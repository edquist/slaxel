<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:47)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> @andrew.melo question on US-CMS Federation, So we count as 7 Sites in federation, which are delivering the needed HS06/Disk Pledge. Vanderbilt is excluded, right? So 2021 Pledge is 23PB and 267kHS06 and 23PB/7 = 3.285 - 20% (leaving 20% for users output, temp, input storage as previous years) - 2628tb/site. Next question - what does account to this 2628 - what about xcache, analysis facilities storage? Or is it only pure cms prod storage?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:59)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Hi Justas, I'm off today, but briefly - we are asking for 120khs06 and 5PB/site (usable). Of that 5PB, 3.5 is the pledge from WLCG, the remaining 1.5PB is above-pledge can include /store/user storage, user-requested datasets (I.e. If a user wants to have some AOD locally for POG work), or the analysis facility storage you described. The intent is to maintain origin storage for users, so xcache doesn't count in that number. You can, of course, put in a request for additional storage to be used for xcache, similar to how everyone requested GPU nodes, and we'll take that into account in our planning<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:52:36)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> But there's also a slight distinction between the pledge and the number we give to DM team for Rucio's usage. WLCG pledge is inclusive of obviously the prod space but also the temp, unmerged space you need to make the prod space run. So the Rucio space is by-definition going to be less than 3.5PB<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:12)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> About xcache I heard differently in the past and it was accounted.  It will be fun year with moving to new storage. So from my side - to reach 3.5 for WLCG will take time due to migration and no ability to move fast from one storage to another, mainly because of many unique files (unmerged, wmcore output, user output) - which cant be easily synced…<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:37)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Wait sorry let me correct myself. April 1st is 4.8PB, April 2022 is 5.0PB<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:52)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> In any case, xcache was not counted and probably will not be counted by WLCG for at least 1 year at the minimum in terms of the pledge<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:56)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Perhaps you can get a completely new RSE configured in Rucio for the Ceph storage then use that to make the migration to live <br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:01)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> *go live<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:56)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> That is what we do - but not April timeline. 5pb - by end of the year. Several operational issues are keeping us back<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:35)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Well, the priority is the 3.3PB for the pledge by April 1. That's a top level milestone that cannot be missed <br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:38)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> There's some leeway for the other 1.5PB, but not much and should be a priority over the others<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:50)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> 5PB is for April 22<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:07)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> All of this is a bit of “broken phone”.<br/>From Stephan:<br/><pre>Hallo Justas,<br/>   we from site support/Facilities and Services have<br/>not started the process. I don't know what triggered<br/>Andrew's slide/request.<br/>   As Nick said, if a site has more disk space/CPU<br/>available/needs a change, no reason to wait until<br/>March/April.</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:51)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Right, there's two different things -- 1) the hardware needs to be deployed/available and 2) CMS should be informed of their increased quota. The only coupling between the two is manually telling nick. But updating the Rucio #s doesn't fulfill the WLCG pledge either<br/>

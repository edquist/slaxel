<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Ah, things I learned -- you still have to install fetch-crl on compute nodes even though CMS gets CRLs from singularity because the SAM tests don't do the same thing<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:05)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> So the total set of things needed on non-interactive nodes is singularity,CVMFS, and fetch-crl? Is there something I'm missing? And then for interactive nodes, is osg-wn-client still needed? (going through our config management and trying to get everything updated right)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Can't you point SAM tests at the same directory on CVMFS?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:08)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I mean, if 100% of CMS jobs are getting the CRLs from there, then shouldn't SAM look in the same place?<br/>

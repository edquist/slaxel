<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I was looking at that this morning.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:21)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> The problem appears to be with generating an <tt>adler32</tt> checksum (I think) from Lustre.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:26)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> is there anything in the logfile about it?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:55)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I have had issues with getting XRootD's checksums to work on filesystems without xattr support.  Is that enabled at Florida?<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:28)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> 190502 17:39:26 14101 ofs_FAttr: Unable to get attr XrdCks.adler32 from /cms/data/store/temp/user/bockjoo/treecopier.py; operation not supported<br/>is the one eariler message in the xrootd log<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(09:46:42)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> During Bestman era, I had to add something and that something was an expensive operation.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:35)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> @bbockelm who is supposed to add the md5 adler32 crc32 to the file attribute?  What does ofs.ckslib * /usr/lib64/libXrdHdfs.so do in Hadoop? Is it for reading checksums or for both reading and writing checksums?<br/>

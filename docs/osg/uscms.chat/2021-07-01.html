<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:56)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Hi, we've (finally) gotten new perfsonar boxes, and I've changed the hostnames in the topology. Is there anything else that needs to be done to update the hostnames globally? If I look at <a href="http://psconfig.osg.org">psconfig.osg.org</a> the old names are still there<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:53:27)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> I don’t believe there’s any automagic OSG topology --&gt; psconfig magic, so the hosts will need added there separately. I can get around to it soon as I have a functioning computer in front of me.<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:53:42)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> (unless Justas is going to do it, I saw you start typing! :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> fair enough. Do I need to wait to tell the vandy admins to run the "psconfig" CLI stuff for when the mesh is updated, or will it work now and just not return anything to test<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:51)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> In theory it will work now and pick it up once the hosts are added<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:52)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> I did see the “both hosts are up” email and noticed I can’t reach either, nor do they seem to have public facing DNS. I planned to reply to that email thread in a bit.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:25)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> OK, I'll reply with the instructions saying to hit the psconfig command now<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:44)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> oh wait, I need to make the DNS, since they don't control the <a href="http://accre.vanderbilt.edu">accre.vanderbilt.edu</a> domain...<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:48)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Not sure it's a huge deal, but it looks like edgar is still in the ACL<br/>

<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:34)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> He's in a bunch of meshes. =/ I'll ping Shawn to get it cleaned up.<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:08)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> Cisco servers? Money grows on trees at Vanderbilt too?  :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:42)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> the VUIT folks are your stereotypical "if it doesn't say enterprise on it, we're not buying it" people. I don't want to know how much the 100G LR (? probably 10 miles to the exchange) optic for that cisco switch cost<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> ... in 2015 or whenever we got it<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:30)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> The first 100Gb line card we had for our old Brocade MLXe was ~$65k I believe, and the CFP2 optic for it cost $18k. I think we considered that a “great deal” at the time too.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:28)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> We got some deal from mellanox where we got 4 optics and a switch, and I think the optics were 20k each? All four of them have single-digit serial numbers, which I think is cool<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:19)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> it had to have been a cool 100k at least for their 100g cisco hardware<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hi all, there's a frontier squid update that we'd like to get into this week's release<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:47)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> would anyone be able to upgrade their squid in the next day or two to verify it for us?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:57)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> sure<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:54)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Hi @bockjoo Regarding the xrootd v4.10 upgrade, you've got all the plugins upgraded as well? That was an issue that bit me:<br/><pre>yum check-update --enablerepo=osg-testing 'xrootd*'</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:34)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Hi @jthiltges I did not use wildcard, instead I installed individually but all seems to be installed<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:59)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I paused after upgrading two servers because the token generated with the command x509-scitoken-init <a href="https://scitokens.org/cms">https://scitokens.org/cms</a> did not work any more.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(14:37:19)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Derek is looking into it.<br/>

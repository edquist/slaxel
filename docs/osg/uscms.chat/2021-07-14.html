<h3>Wed Jul 14, 2021 : #uscms (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(08:55:10)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> That should be the case -- I can go look.  BTW can you break these out by the dir one above?  I think you went one too far and are listing the subdirs for the tasks for each workflow.    What are the numbers to the left?  # files?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:41)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Count of jobs, I will break by subjobs later (after meeting)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:23)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> to first order, I agree that those merge jobs look like their priorities are way too low<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:49)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Ok, I got confused on question. This is not files, this is condor jobs - and afair - Merge/LogCollect/Cleanup should have highest prio. (Simple bash script can run in cron mode and keep editing all of them)<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:09:10)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> I see it was mentioned here (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yORJd6rWZeMyxXMGPQsaovOWjbFnEegXwukVedlFy50/edit#">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yORJd6rWZeMyxXMGPQsaovOWjbFnEegXwukVedlFy50/edit#</a>) in todays meeting - but no details what was discussed<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:32)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> the 3rd column is prio, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:13:39)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:45)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> So if no solution by end of today - the only thing I suggest is to drain us from prod.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:35)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Would it work to turn down your "regular" rucio quota to get some of the datasets evacuated from disk?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:49)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> no. our quota is 0 and Rucio team deleted already everything what they can (and left me with 1PB to migrate)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Sigh... well, then yeah, looks bad<br/>

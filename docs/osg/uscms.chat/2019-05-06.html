<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(09:29:09)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I did. In the past, I had to add user_xattr option to mount the /cms and adler32 checksum was manually added if I remember correctly. But this does not look right. There must be some automatic way to add the checksum during the file creation/close. Hope RC can figure out during this week's downtime.<br/>

<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:06:29)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> There is nothing much in the log. It has the same info as one on the client side (Permission denied).<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:07:09)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I have created another redirector that does not report to the upper redirector.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:07:25)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> This redirector does not have this issue.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:07:49)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> So the davs is mainly used by the MC stageout.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:08:31)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I need to change the redirector from one to another on storage.xml for davs protocol.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(07:09:17)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> for now. I have to solve the issue. if davs protocol fails, SAM mc stageout test (#8) will fail.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:12:03)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @bockjoo - I'm at a review today so can only half pay attention.  Does the failure occur against the redirector or the data server?  You should be able to tell the difference.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:26:31)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> It's on a redirector. I set up another redirector without pointing to the fnal redirector, but this one works for me for now.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:27:16)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I am also on the road all day today so I won't be able to respond quickly.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ok.  Let's pick it back up tomorrow then.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:41:46)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I will be on the road for a while. Can you give me some ideas whenever you have? I will check this channel from time to time. Thanks!<br/>

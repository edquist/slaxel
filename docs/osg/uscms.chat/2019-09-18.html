<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:19:00)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> My user is asking if he could mount analysis machine home directory using sshfs. Does anyone know if this will cause any trouble for other users?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:28:48)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> It's super slow... I used to use it for development way way back when I was still tethered to an IDE, and even moving text files around was slow.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:33:28)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Do you have any suggestion for alternative?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:34:16)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> What's their usecase?<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:38:26)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> He wants to use some IDE like PyCharm, Eclipse, with things and spaces on the analysis machines.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:45:26)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> That's exactly what I was doing before, I'd suggest doing something like VNC and running the IDE on the analysis machine and just forwarding the screen instead of running the IDE locally and opening the files remotely<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(08:52:15)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> They have to do port forwarding over SSH for security, but otherwise it's good<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:58:05)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> OK. Thanks!<br/>

<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'm not sure how it worked, but it worked.... I've got two hosts <tt>xrootd1/2.accre.vanderbilt.edu</tt> with <tt><a href="http://xrootd.accre.vanderbilt.edu">xrootd.accre.vanderbilt.edu</a></tt> pointing to both hosts, then two PTR records pointing back (though I'm seeing that the <tt>xrootd1/2</tt> ptr records made it to the public internet, but within vanderbilt it's stale and only <tt>xrootd</tt> showed up). Each host has 2 data servers on 1095 and 1096 (1095 uses FUSE, 1096 uses an xrootd plugin I'm testing). Both of the servers are using a cert that for the CN <tt><a href="http://xrootd.accre.vanderbilt.edu">xrootd.accre.vanderbilt.edu</a></tt>, and the xrootd CLI seems to not complain<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:15:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> How far back in CMSSW do I need to go to test that older clients won't barf on this config?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:59)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Once I know this works OK, I want to start up a 2nd redirector on xrootd1:1094 (it's currently only on xrootd2), then spin up some more server nodes<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:38)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Or, alternately, is there something in Monit or similar that'll show auth failures from clients?<br/>

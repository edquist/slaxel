<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:19)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Would anyone be willing to generate like 6-8 dummy certs and give them to me so I can bridge while I wait for digicert to get their act together?<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:20:29)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> I am not sure what you mean. Why don't you install simpleCA and sign your own host certificates?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:27)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> because the rest of CMS won't accept them?<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:38)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> You need dummy certs anyway. Florida servers will honor your simpleCA signed host certificate if no one else.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:31)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Rise and rebel!<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:30)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> You have downtime until July 1 and nothing else will work right?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:13)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Well, I was asking for someone to generate certs with their Incommon portal and give them to me.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:09)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> The computing is working fine since the factories accept letsencrypt certs. It's just the storage that's goofed up because it's not globally trusted<br/>

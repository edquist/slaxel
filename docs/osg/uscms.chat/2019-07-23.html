<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is it just me or is vidyo in rough shape right now?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:32)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> people are blipping in and out, but the quality is OK for me (and i'm currently in colombia)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:34)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> @gattebury -- I think I'll have to just do the perfsonar stuff myself. I've been waiting since december to get some hypervisors connected (they're sitting in the rack with power and a 1g connection to provision, but no "real" interfaces). How bad of a time should I expect?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:42)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> If you just use the CentOS 7 install ISO for it it’s really easy … pretty sure you can just follow the directions for doing a “yum install” on an existing CentOS system as well. I’ve done it many times and it’s always been easy enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:04)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Oh, I thought there was jus t a configuration I needed to update or something<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:19)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> The configuration is mostly just adding things like contact info / latitude/longitude --- then a one liner to add the appropriate mesh URL to it (it’s mentioned in my previous meeting notes, or you can just probably look at the OSG deployment docs as I think it’s there too)<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:28)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> feel free to email/slack me if you get stuck / hungup somewhere<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:28)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> So the mesh URL is what I'm mostly missing now?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:29)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> That, and you need to be on EL7 — the EL6 release hasn’t been supported or updated for quite a while now<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:40)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> OK. I'll give it a try :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>

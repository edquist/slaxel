<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(10:02:06)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Is there a way to get pilots to your site during a downtime? I had to change our CE hostname and it's hard to be sure it worked w/o having job pressure show up<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> factory ops may be able to override the downtime to send a few test pilots<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:56)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> YEah, I've got something wrong .. SAM test jobs succeed to the old hostname but not the new one<br/>

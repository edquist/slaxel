<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:01)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> @spiperov Since the NN and SNN is the brain of the ~10PB hadoop storage system/clusters (and projected to increase for Run4), I think it's worth investing in 2 physical nodes with just enough power to handle the tasks well for peace of mind (i.e. not to worry about VMs getting beaten, running into swap issues etc).<br/><br/>You can use some of your good old WNs that you plan to retire just because they are out-of-warranty (which otherwise can serve for 4-5 more years with the kind of minimal load those will have as a NN/SNN) OR spend ~$3k (total) on 2 new 1U nodes with 4C/8T CPU, 64G RAM (with room to expand), and 4 disk slots (for a solid raid 10 with 500GB/1TB HDDs) or appropriate number of SSDs (U.2/M.2 etc) to maintain the file system integrity and redundancy in case of issues. The new nodes would/could serve for 10 years with minimal maintenance.<br/><br/>At Wisconsin, we configured hadoop to run on HA mode 4 years ago. Our active/standby NN nodes are : a dedicated 10 year old X5550Â @ 2.67GHz hardware with a 1TB RAID5 (5x250GB disk + 1 hot spare), 64GB RAM, and a 4 year old 1U hardware with 4C/8T CPU, 64G RAM, and RAID 10 (4x1TB). I am hoping that these 2 pieces of dedicated hardware will continue serving another 5+ years without issues.<br/>

<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:36)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> @andrew.melo just to confirm - wlcg pledge for 2021 - is what you define, right? wlcg pledge for us-cms change into 1 US-CMS-T2 entity. Or?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:28)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Kinda -- it's one single "federation" pledge, but to fulfill it, we need to know that Sum(site deployments) &gt; Federation_pledge<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:49)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I was gonna bring it up at the next T2 meeting, but it won't hurt for me to mail about it now<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:11)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Just from my side - CMS Will need to wait a month or so. I drained as much as we can hdfs to move to ceph -  but we wait for multiuser bug fix (xrootd/checksum related)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:36)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> We can talk about it over email<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:38)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> @justas.balcas I had it in my head the multiuser bug was fixed, but looked at the github issue last week and saw it’s still outstanding. Was there some kind of workaround you’re already doing?<br/>

<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:40)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> for checksum - I cant confirm it works, until #21 is solved :wink:<br/>

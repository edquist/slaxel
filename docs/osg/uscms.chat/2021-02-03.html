<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(05:48:30)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> I believe we are looking more at JBODs as a solution for storage requirements too.  We installed one about this time a year ago and have not had any problems with it so far.  @spiperov can probably relate some experiences as he has been more hands on with our storage than I have recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:36)</span> <b>spiperov:</b></span> On the subject of JBODs - as Nick wrote our last-year's 60-disk SuperMicro fitted well in the racks (with room even for a cable-management arm on the back), and integrated without troubles in HDFS. The only measurable effect is the higher memory usage of the storage node we connected it to, and a not-so-straightforward procedure of restarting the node (which we had to do once so far).<br/><br/>The new 102-disk JBOD is a larger beast (that is - longer. much longer - 41.5"), and comes with mounting rails that did not fit in our regular configuration of the racks. We had to move the vertical mounting rails of the rack further back. Otherwise it still fits, but there will be no room for cable-management arm at the back.<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:25)</span> <b>smithnp:</b></span> We had a question about running namenodes as virtual machines.  Has anyone here had experience good/bad with that?  We are currently considering converting our secondary to a VM.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:55)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I suppose as long as the block device underneath has enough performance, you should be OK<br/>

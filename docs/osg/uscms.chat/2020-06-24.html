<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:08)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Weird question -- we have SLURM @ vanderbilt, but our users typically work on the LPC, which is condor-based. Getting N grad students to figure out how to rewrite their submission scripts to work w/SLURM is apparently a task I can't perform. Is it possible to somehow configure a condor schedd (???) to do the blahp routing stuff to let users submit condor jobs who get converted into slurm jobs<br/>

<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @justas.balcas, apologies not replying also here on your question and only GGUS few days back... I think we all agreed at this stage run some perfsonar tests between CERN and Caltech, there is not much we can do in terms of debugging for the xrootd tests, we know it's happening at high rate from overseas client connectivity, in particular for this ETF tests ... I'd still dive more in deep of the probe that is executed from eft nodes and uses xrootd python bindings ... again, to rule out any xrootd problem after discussion with devs we need to debug python probe itself.  Unfortunately I'm not well versed with python debugger at all and need a help with it. I should get help on that next week from somebody who knows more about python debugger.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:04)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Thanks Marian for keeping me updated. Regarding perfsonar, I know this is not for you, but if SST could handle this between T1s/T2US/T2CERN - that would be awesome.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> We can talk about it with SST but I suspect they would need end-to-end instructions how to do it operation-wise and how to read all the perfsonar/maddash and whatever other metrics ... In the GGUS ticket we've got promise from Marian Babik he will setup the tests so I'd trust his knowledge here and after we get something useful from the test we could push for the instructions and hand over doing exercise to SST ... We can talk to Stephan Lammel about it as he runs SST effort for CMS. Or if you have better idea...?<br/>

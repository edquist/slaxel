<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:16)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Hi Folks, As order times goes on now, anyone else looking at AMD 7443 and AMD 7513? We are targeting higher clock speed (7443) - but our vendors warned us already that there is a huge wait time for 7443. Any others you look ?<br/>

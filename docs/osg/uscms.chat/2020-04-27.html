<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:20)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Is monit-grafana hanging for anyone else?<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:23)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'm trying real hard to get some plots for our grant and I"m just getting pinwheels<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:32)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> It seems OK-ish for me, maybe a little slower but certainly functional. Same was true this morning when some others were reporting it being broken. Seems maybe regional or intermittent ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:23)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> The grant folks want a year of info which probably doesn't help at all, even the 30 day binning takes like 5 mins to render :/<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(15:27:00)</span> <b>burt:</b></span> People were asking about this on the CMS CompOps mailing list too<br/>

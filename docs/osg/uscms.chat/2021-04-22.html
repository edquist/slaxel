<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:06)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> @andrew.melo Based on CPU2017_int benchmarks 7513 is better. Suggestions? In the end would be really nice to match what vendors provide (CPU_2017) with what we expect from node (I just keep hope that benchmark group will do correct thing :slightly_smiling_face: )<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:49)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> It's really hard to say what is better :) I guess I'd say that we tend to emphasize performance/$ over other metrics<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:56)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> if performance == cpu_2017_int - that is easy to find out. Anything else - bewitch :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:49)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Ah, I see<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:01)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> well ... Hopefully there should be a small epsilon between the two<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:18)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> particularly since the two AMD nodes only vary by (I assume) cores and clock?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:12)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> 2.65 vs 2.8 and 32cores vs 24. While on price - 32core is ~800$ more expensive (but we are suggested to get at the same price as 24core). From experience higher clock speed is better,  but how much diff will be - is unclear<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:25)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I'd naiively argue (?) that since CMS cpu eff for the application is like 70%, a faster clock just means more time waiting on I/O, but I have nothing to prove that<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:35)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Ok, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(12:44:59)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> I've seen plenty of evidence of scaling with CPU type in MC generation.  That said digging into that 70% would be useful exercise beyond it being a path to insanity.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(12:52:16)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> For sure, I could see different workloads behaving differently, I was just quoting the top-level CMS cpu eff that gets reported by WLCG<br/>

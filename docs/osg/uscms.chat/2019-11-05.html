<h3>Tue Nov 5, 2019 : #uscms (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:24)</span> <b>goughes:</b></span> How sites do perms on /store/user might be a good topic of discussion in the next T2 meeting.<br/>
<span style="color: #619a4f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:44)</span> <b>clundstedt:</b></span> Seconded<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:03)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> not only /store/user - but there is seems security issue<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:47)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> as we run as nobody on our end (other sites might be the same) - means than any other (ligo,osg,glow,fnal) pilots can read data on hdfs<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:16)</span> <b>goughes:</b></span> I think most sites run a simple authentication model on HDFS, so the typical unix filesystem permissions are what you have to work with.<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:37)</span> <b>goughes:</b></span> In the fuse case, you don't really have any extra layers of authentication that you get with xrootd/gridftp via lcmaps or the xrootd authfile<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:58)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> For us, we make /store readable by the group "cms" and unreadable by "other", and run everything CMS related as users who are in the cms group, so only CMS can see the filesystem<br/>

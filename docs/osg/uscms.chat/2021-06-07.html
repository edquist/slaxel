<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:41)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> For HA redirectors, how are people doing the certs? I have a cert for each redir with the subject = the "true" hostname, which works for the xrootd protocol, but now I'm seeing that HTTP rejects it because the subject doesn't match the DNS RR record. Do I need to have a SAN for the certs for the DNS RR entry as well?<br/>

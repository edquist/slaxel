<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:59)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> @swohlstadter2017 is the current Sysadmin on the T3 cluster at Florida Tech. She is trying to install cvmfs client on her cluster. According to the documentation , <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/install-cvmfs/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/install-cvmfs/</a> , there is a compatibility issue with CernVM File System and EL &lt;7.5. She is currently utilizing the most recent version of ROCKS for her cluster, which is based on CentOS 7.4. I don't know much about cluster management with ROCKS. Does anyone have an advice for her?<br/>

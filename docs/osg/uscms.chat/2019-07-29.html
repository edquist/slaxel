<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:17)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @bockjoo Regarding HDD brands, we've been buying HGST lately. But we don't have much (any?) experience with the helium-filled models.<br/>HGST and Toshiba have seemed generally good on the stats released by Backblaze.<br/>Also, you might be happier with a 4-drive RAID-10 if you can swing it.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:30)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Hi @jthiltges Do you have specific model names for HGST and Toshiba? And where to get them?<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(11:55:04)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> By the way, I need the HDD for the cvmfs-NFS (readonly).<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:20)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Our recent storage purchase had HGST 12GB SAS drives, model HUH721212AL5200. Hopefully they hold up OK!<br/><br/>For buying a couple drives, I think we (by who I mean Garhan) sometimes goes to the usual websites: Amazon, Newegg, etc.<br/><br/>But we've also placed small orders through our whitebox (Supermicro, etc.) hardware vendors: Aspen Systems, AdvancedHPC, etc. They've been great about suggesting the best model for our purposes.<br/><br/>If you are using ZFS, adding an SSD or NVMe for L2ARC might be quite helpful with the read-only dataset.<br/>

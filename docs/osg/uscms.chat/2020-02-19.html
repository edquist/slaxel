<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:19:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @andrew.melo:<br/>&gt;  Too many attempts to gain dfs read access to the file<br/>That's XRootD's funny way of saying that too many sources are excluded by the client.  Depending on what the client is doing (did it exclude because it wants more sources?  Or because existing sources are broken?), it's either relevant or irrelevant.  Ignore these unless you see other symptoms of issues.<br/>

<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:00)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> I thought someone had figured this out a year or so ago but I can’t for the life of me find any reference to it. Using the checkmk /webapi.py endpoint would make sense but I just tried and at least my normal user cert doesn’t have permission to do such magic. In theory an automation user can be added to support this but again, I can’t find any reference indicating such a thing exists.<br/><br/>Probably worth an email thread - surely someone has done this or there is sufficient demand to let it be done.<br/>

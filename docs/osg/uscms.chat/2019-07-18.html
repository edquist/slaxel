<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:00)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> OK, planning on moving Vandy's hosts back to <a href="http://Vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt.edu</a> -- is there any reason to have unique hostnames for all the xrootd hosts? (Thinking of saving $ on the certs) or, can I just have N hosts map forwards and backwards to the same host name and CMSSW won't complain<br/>

<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is anyone <b>@here</b> using htcondor 8.8.x with their htcondor-ce?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:35)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> I do in comet but CMS is not using its allocation<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i ask because 8.8 changed the routing strategy from "round-robin" to "first match"  by default<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> however, we found a bug in the "ordering" of the routes (they're hash table order, not the order that you write them in the config)<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:58)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> we use latest condor with old htcondor-ce<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(16:32:06)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> <br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:32:33)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it's an underlying condor bug so htcondor-ce version shouldn't matter<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> the problem is if we fix the bug, then the underlying order of the routes will change, and if by change hash table order works for a site, we'll break the routing<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:00)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> this may not be a problem in the OSG since we always told you guys to write your routes so that their requirements are mutually exclusive<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:37)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Actually, @blin the while ticket you CCd me on was selling this as not having it be mutually exclusive :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> so tl;dr, is anyone using a CE (any version) with condor 8.8 where the routes are NOT configured as mutually exclusive?<br/>

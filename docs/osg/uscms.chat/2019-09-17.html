<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:36)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> @marian how does the throttling works? Lets say I add<br/>xrootd.fslib throttle default<br/>throttle.throttle concurrency 20<br/>Does it mean that a single user will  not be able to get more than 20 open connections? Is it based on user dn or unix account?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:04)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> just reading twiki seems I misunderstood concurrency limit. The issue is not xrootd overload, but once all nodes (gridftp/xrootd on our end runs on same node) do more than 50gbps outside, xrootd timeouts. So far seems xrootd sam test probe timeouts are too short (30s). So limiting xrootd will not solve I think<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah I was going to point you to this twiki actually: <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/XrootdThrottlingExperimental">https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/XrootdThrottlingExperimental</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:31:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I thought you're not only complaining about SAM tests but recently also about the other load<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that is prevention to other SAM unrelated overloads I believe ... for the SAM tests, I'm restarting my tests to see result in debug mode as suggested also by SAM developer<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:48)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Once limited gridftp phedex account, got back to normal with very few failures<br/>

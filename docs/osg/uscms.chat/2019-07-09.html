<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:41:17)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> known excitement which needs remedied (as in, we’re bad and that host is MTU 1500 with the full path to it being 9000 capable) … so in that sense, yes I’ll indeed look into it :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:48)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> FWIW this has long been on my plate to fix --- that said, I think you really want to test with <tt>-M do -s 8972</tt> to achieve what you want. Your <tt>-s 9000</tt> is likely just getting fragmented, unless both you and FNAL have MTUs that are actually &gt; 9000.<br/><br/>Either way, it’s technically broken @ UNL and I’ll sort it out.<br/>

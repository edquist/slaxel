<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:11)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Does someone have a standard procedure to configure IPv6 on worker nodes?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:18)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> There really shouldn’t be anything unique or special about IPv6 on worker nodes with respect to CMS — how it gets configured really depends on what you/your computing center wants. At Nebraska we use SLAAC for all the Tier2 related things so most hosts just “get” IPv6 by default - we don’t actually configure anything specifically on the hosts themselves.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:11)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> We have manual ipv6 on xrootd machines, but nothing else has ipv6. So, should I suggest SLAAC to my research computing center for worker nodes?<br/>
<span style="color: #d1707d"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:29)</span> <b>gattebury:</b></span> That’s really a question for your networking / computing center people as I’m sure they have preferences on how they’d like to deal with it long term. As in, they should work towards supporting IPv6 with whatever IPAM system they use if they don’t already.<br/><br/>SLAAC will enable easy automatic IPv6 addresses on the hosts for instance, but doesn’t in itself give you DNS which is certainly required. If they want full control over addresses/DNS chances are they’ll want to do DHCPv6 or something. Without knowing the details of how your network/IT teams operate it’s probably best to start by telling them you need IPv6 across all the worker nodes and leave it up to them to determine the implementation that fits the environment there.<br/>
<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:56)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Thanks for the explanation! They exhausted IPv4 addresses in NAT, so the network engineers are suggesting IPv6 for the RC, but the RC network responsible was asking some questions that I didn't understand.<br/>

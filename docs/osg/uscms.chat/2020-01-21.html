<h3>Tue Jan 21, 2020 : #uscms (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:43)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Can anyone point me toward documentation that shows how the new site readiness math works?<br/>I'm looking at the report.html, and Nebraska's Jan 19 is confusing me.<br/>It shows 100% for SAM, HC, and FTS. But 87% site readiness.<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:30)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> "unknown" metrics push the % down<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:17)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> I wish they would instead have "site readiness" be the number that makes logical sense, and then add an extra row for "unknown status"<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:35)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> No unknown SAM tests that day. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:23)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> It seems unknown SAM results are ignored, but not counted as success. (At least from the math that Carl pointed out to me.)<br/>
<span style="color: #a72f79"><span style="font-size: small">(17:46:15)</span> <b>andrew.melo:</b></span> Yeah, I don't like it either...<br/>

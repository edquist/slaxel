<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:49)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> Hi, we should look at spark - it could be used for aggregation and data enrichment (e. g. OIM). It is what CERN using - seems to be very reasonable<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:12:09)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I’ve looked at it in the past, and it’s worth looking into some more, but I’m not sure it meets our use case. It’s for performing processing on distributed data, like Hadoop.<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:26)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> not necessarily: you could have just couple of VMs (static installation )<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:08)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> who will run those services? I believe there is value in the data processing model CERN is using, but there’s a lot of overhead that I’m not sure we can justify (machines, services, people to run both).<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:59)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> but I digress.. I agree we should look more at spark (or storm), if nothing else as an experiment to prove our modular architecture actually works in practice<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:13)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> if the idea to use "mature open source" technology  whenever possible<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:00)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> if it is too expensive to run and maintain - yes, but if we are trying to use common tools for re-processing it probably worth looking into this; it also could to talk ES (use replay mechanism)<br/>

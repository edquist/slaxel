<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:53)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hello, people of the GRÅCC<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I have a question about getting support, when it appears that accounting data is defective<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:33:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Is there a specific mailing list or something for that, or should I send a general “<a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>” email, or … ?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> there's <a href="mailto:gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu">gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu</a> (thats where gracc tickets go)<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:23)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ok, and I should go ahead and email there?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:23)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yup<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:39)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ok thank yo<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:41)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> you<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> BTW, why did you choose to use a UNL mailing list for this, instead of Fermilab and an <a href="http://opensciencegrid.org">opensciencegrid.org</a> domain?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:37)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> no reason I don't think.  Just easier to make at the time for Marian.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:43)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hm<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I would argue that an OSG resource (in this case, a mailing list) should be maintainable by OSG staff in general<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:08)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I agree with you.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> and we can certainly change it.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:32)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Well, go ahead and throw that on your (collective) list then<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:51)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> And when you do that, please make sure that I am added as a quiet owner of the Fermilab-based mailing list<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:49)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> there’s an existing GRACC-PROJECT@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG list that Marian owns and has Tim as a quiet owner…<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:19)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yes, I was added recently. But I guess it is up to you folks to decide what the purpose and use of each mailing list is.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:25)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> anyways, not that I have a say anymore, but I’d say any issues with accounting data should be reported via GOC ticket, so it can be tracked<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:42)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I am happy to do that as well<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:21:03)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Which should I do? (I am about halfway through writing the email, so I can address it anywhere yet.)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:24:31)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I defer to Derek, he’ll probably be the one working on it anyways<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:25:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ticket please. <br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:17)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Great, thanks guys, sent.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @cat, if you file GOC ticket and assign support centre "GRACC Ops" we receive it as email to <tt><a href="mailto:gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu">gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu</a></tt>. That email list created for that purpose mostly. We can create <tt><a href="mailto:gracc-support@opensciencegrid.org">gracc-support@opensciencegrid.org</a></tt> if desired and redirect to <tt><a href="mailto:gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu">gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu</a></tt>. GRACC-PROJECT@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG list was intended for all people involved during development process of GRACC and still serves for bigger audience when we announce meeting or where we send backup summary report for instance. After commissioning GRACC and retiring GRATIA web we decided use <tt>GRACC-SUPPORT@</tt> convention for Operators to receive anything GOC ticket-like. Hope that makes more sense now...<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:32)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @marian (and others), if we create a gracc-support mailing list at Fermilab, it should (ultimately) *replace* the UNL one. I think it is bad practice to have a mailing list that is required for proper operation of the project to be separated like that. Kyle and I are working hard to clean up the mailing list mess at Fermilab right now, and it’s a pain because it has been done haphazardly over a long time. I suppose another possibility is to get user accounts on the UNL mailing list system for me and maybe others in OSG, but that seems like a pain, too.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:50)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> As for the distinctions between support and project mailing lists, that is fine and is up to you all.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:00)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> surely we can replace if we create one at Fermilab, I can do that later as low priority if OK ... btw, I've discussed mailing list for gracc-support with Kyle when he was creating GRACC Ops support unit, back then he wasn't picky where it should be created, just said something along the lines "give me whatever mailing list you like" ... and I had issues get to fnal listserv (which I still have) due passwd I forgot so also that's yet another why I gave him <tt><a href="mailto:gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu">gracc-support@listserv.unl.edu</a></tt> in the end ...<br/>

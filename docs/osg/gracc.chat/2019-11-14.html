<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:40)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i have always thought that CPU hours is Core hours for 1 core jobs... and that statistically if i want to measure the performance of the jobs there, i just divide Total CPU hours/Total Wall hours --- in that case, ~30% which is often seen<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(20:04:56)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yeah, your formula seems right.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(20:05:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> cpus hours in this case is the the equivalent to user_cpu, for example from <tt>top</tt><br/>

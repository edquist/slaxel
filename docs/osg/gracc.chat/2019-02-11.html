<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:17)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> hey all, posted in #-support but this might be more relevant -- seems gracc is down right now?  kibana reports an error with the 'elasticsearch' plugin while everything else seems to just report various nginx errors...<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:22)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we've had some back and forth in #osg-ops. there are currently issues with a number of OSG hosts that we hope to resolve shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, still suffering from gracc (not only) issues, sorry!<br/>

<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(17:39:49)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I figured out why the Kibana “discover” tab times out so often for gracc… As of 4.3 Kibana uses the <tt>_field_stats</tt> API to get the date range for every index matching the pattern, which means elasticsearch has to hit every shard when you first load the page. So that’s what’s timing out, not actually loading data. Using the legacy time-based index pattern solves that, but it’s deprecated. Monthly indices will certainly also help.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(22:36:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> would we benefit from any sort of upgrade?  maybe closing indices?<br/>

<h3>Mon Jun 26, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:59)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all -- you guys remember about a month ago the issues i was having with finding the stats in gracc after renaming CancerComputer_Miron_CE to CancerComputer_Hotel_CE?  well, re-adding Miron back into OIM worked for a while, but in the last 3-7 days or so all the old results (those tied to Miron) aren't shown in my 'CCHDV' Site Summary anymore, and although I can find the results for Miron in the 'Site Summary (Non-OIM)' I can't find Hotel there anymore.  Just wondering if something's changed in relation to how either the Site Summary is amalgomated and/oror what the criteria is for the list of sites in the Non-OIM Site Summary recently?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:03)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> @ian_cancercomputer I suspect that the Miron resource being both “inactive” and “disabled” is causing GRACC to not find it anymore. @sbhat do you remember what we decided about that? <a href="https://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=890">https://oim.opensciencegrid.org/oim/resource?id=890</a><br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:16)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> yeah - I'm checking that right now, actually<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:28)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> to see how we checked the logic<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:05)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> yes - all of the resources that the OIM parsing gets are active<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:11)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> disabled doesn't seem to matter though<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:53)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> hm, that's odd.  I'm pretty sure it was 'inactive' ever since i recreated it in OIM, and it -was- showing right up until it was marked disabled last week....<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:51)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> In general, I'm personally more than fine with just Hotel showing up in 'Site Summary'; however i would like to have some view that would allow me to include both CancerComputer_Hotel_CE -and- CancerComputer_Miron_CE together if possible..  the Non-OIM Site Summary did have this ability before but I think that list filters out active-OIM sites now? (its list is way shorter than it was a couple of weeks ago)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> could someone update me about gracc status from last week what we want to report at GOC Ops meeting? (my week was flaky last week keep an eye on gracc things, sick leave, vacation and other ops)<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:34)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> we didn't meet<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:51)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> since Kevin, Tanya, and I had a workshop<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:59)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> and you were out<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, so we can provide no report for the past week unless there was anything urgent to take care of<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:44)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> @ian_cancercomputer : GRACC is excluding inactive resources.  Whether or not we want to be doing that is another question.  I'm going to open a GOC ticket to ask the OIM folks what they'd recommend as the "correct" setting for your particular situation<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:50)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> re: Active and Disabled<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:55)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> we can then look into seeing if we want to make a change with the way GRACC handles these two flags at the summarizer level - which will inform if we'll need to consider the view you're requesting<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(12:14:04)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> @sbhat Thanks!!  Yeah, procedure and documentation in general, for renaming or migrating CE services from one identity to another would be helpful to ferm up I think; no point in gracc group doing one thing if OIM wants to do another..  The inactive/disabled way sounded right at the time...<br/>

<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(08:23:55)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> @kretzke: looks great: 1. do you want to mention anything about raw data backup 2. make more emphasis on ES - hardware concerns (at least sound grave while you talk about it) 3. mention than Gratia Collector will be retired at some point 4. will gracc-collector remain or probes will talk to RabbitMQ directly?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:09:22)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> thanks for the feedback. 1) added backup to the figure, I don’t think we’ve made any decisions on that. 2) :neutral_face: 3 and 4) added gratia phase-out to diagram<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:01)</span> <b>boj:</b></span> So either on the status slide or conclusion slide you might want to say that we're targeting complete functionality in September<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:53)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I don’t recall that. “in September” meaning by Oct 1? I think that’s reasonable<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:05)</span> <b>boj:</b></span> I think we've slid so end of September<br/>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:30)</span> <b>boj:</b></span> so just say "in September"<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:18)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> works for me. looks like @dweitzel has the summary and request agents just about done, so I’ll say those will be deployed in August<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:14)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> The summary dashboard actually seems pretty performant, took under 30s to pull up daily for last six months <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/gracc-payload-summary?from=now-6M&amp;to=now">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/gracc-payload-summary?from=now-6M&amp;to=now</a><br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:57)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> although I’ve started reprocessing some data to fill in holes (records are missing <tt>CoreHours</tt>) so that will up the cluster load<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:04)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> in the near future I’d like to bring the cluster down to upgrade to 2.3 and also reduce the memory allocated to JVM heap, to open up more for disk cache. GC is getting down to ~6GB so I’m thinking I'll try 16GB<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Network switch’a’roo is happening in a few minutes rather than Sunday.  GRACC (and UNL’s openstack) may go away for not more than a minute.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:31)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> ok, I’ll try not to panic<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> it may or may not happen at exactly 2.  Perfectly timed for your meeting!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> it’s mostly out of our control, Our IT group is doing it.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:41)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @kretzke: did you and Derek touch base about updated LogStash settings?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:14)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> no. what settings?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ah - he had another RabbitMQ exchange he wanted you to forward to ElasticSearch.  @dweitzel ?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:05)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yes, I will need to talk to you @kretzke when I have a minute to sit down and think.<br/>

<h3>Mon Jul 6, 2020 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Just so everyone is up to date.  The EGI accounting website appears to not be updating anymore.  CRIC is updating, and looks accurate for June.  No confirmation from EGI / WLCG, but I thought that was the plan from a while ago.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Oddly, the EGI website stopped updating late in the month, so it has "most" of June.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> CRIC usage exactly equals GRACC, for the ~6 sites I spot checked.<br/>

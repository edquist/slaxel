<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Kevin, did the resummarize actually do anything to fix Stanford reporting?  There just were no records, even raw, for payload jobs.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:40)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> yes, since we just got the records today<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ah, ok.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I still don't understand why we re-summarized.  Wouldn't it have just showed up eventually?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:31)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> maybe. some of the records were older than seven days, or close at least. and the request agent had crashed.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:40:05)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> hum... what was the error at the request agent?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:16)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> the usual. Marina has been working on getting TLS working on RabbitMQ, so probably had to restart it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, ok.<br/>

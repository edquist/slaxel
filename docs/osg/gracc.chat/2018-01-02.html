<h3>Tue Jan 2, 2018 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(07:50:38)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> Hi all, do we know if a January 2018 raw record index was created? The reports I send at FNAL gave me a "no such index" error <br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:47)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> the Index Pattern generating code of the reports would have looked for something along the lines of "gracc.osg.raw-2018.01"<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:34)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> @marian did you deploy the alias creation script?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi Kevin, I thought I did, but looks my cron is empty on new FE ... I'll look at it and fix ... does it cause any real issues?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:45)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> yes, queries generally go through the aliases<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:59)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I suspect that’s also why there’s not a 2018 summary index yet<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:37)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> btw, ssh is asking me for a password so it must not have my key<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:38:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> your key is in there ... have you checked your ssh worked before? sometimes in the week before Xmas? Just curious if ssh ever worked for you to new FE<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:24)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> no, never tried<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:17)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, ok ... checking few other things, could be something else blocks everybody else not being valid hcc (holland computing center) user<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:38)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> what’s ownership and permissions on the .ssh directory and files?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> old FE was setup in less restricted way<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:45:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, it it in root cron in fact, just was commented out, my bad! I ran aliases manually now and enabling to run hourly<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> will check your access now ... must be that @sbhat has same problem to ssh ... not sure he tried before ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks for pointing that out and also with aliases!<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:19)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> still same issue. Yeah, I don’t think he’s tried<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:55)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> I have not tried. And thanks for fixing it! <br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @marian has the cron job for the indices been activated?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Also, has access been given to Kevin and Shreyas?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:20)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Kevin found the issue, request agent was till running on the old FE and for some reason getting summary requests ... request agent was stopped on old FE ... access should be fixed, too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> cron is also enabled to create aliases hourly<br/>

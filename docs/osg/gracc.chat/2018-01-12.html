<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:20)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @marian Yes, we are getting a lot of alerts about the queue sizes.  Eric (Cloud Admin here) says that some users on the machine are writing to disk more than normal.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, was about to bring that up since I also received email alerts ... Can they limit such user?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:19)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> or figure what is he doing?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:23)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'm not sure they even have monitoring good enough to identify the user.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> seems like # of messages queued are going up and down above treshold of 10000 in last 12hrs ... I'm not sure what kind if preventative actions we have on the GRACC side at disposal to eliminate negative impact (if there is any) if Anvil can't cope with the current load while bad user is still doing nasty i/o things? just trying to figure any survival procedure for the weekend if needed from the GRACC side ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> maybe @kretzke @dweitzel has any idea ^?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:34:18)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The rabbitmq should survive for quite a while at the current rate. I could start up the archived somewhere else if needed. <br/>

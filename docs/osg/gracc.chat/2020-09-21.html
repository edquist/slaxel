<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:37:16)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Looks like Site = N/A hours have jumped up a bunch lately? Anyone looking at that?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Not recently.  I'll take a look at it.  Most are coming from a probably ill-configured gratia probe.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> What report are you seeing the N/A, so I can make sure we are looking at the same thing?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:05)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> The site hours by month thing that you made me.<br/>

<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:53)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> Hey all, I have been directed to this goc ticket for WLCG / APEL reporting: <a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34760">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34760</a><br/>apparently records getting sent for <tt>SWT2_CPB</tt> after May have been showing 0 cpu time.  Any idea where to investigate this?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's actually also for some other US sites, no all are affected, though ... accounting report is here: <a href="https://accounting.egi.eu/tier2/country/USA/sumcpu_days/SITE/DATE/2017/3/2017/9/lhc/onlyinfrajobs/">https://accounting.egi.eu/tier2/country/USA/sumcpu_days/SITE/DATE/2017/3/2017/9/lhc/onlyinfrajobs/</a> ... I wonder what we have in GRACC for that, actually. @kretzke, could you perhaps remind us which dashboard and magic query could show us equivalent of APEL accounting?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:41)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @kretzke could we do the indices switch-a-roo before the meeting, so we can discuss and look at the results for the meeting?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:17)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> what indices switch? not sure if it's related, there is running snapshot backup for aliases <tt>gracc.osg.raws-* and gracc.osg-transfer.raw-*</tt> ... just to be aware of...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> We're changing the summary index<br/>

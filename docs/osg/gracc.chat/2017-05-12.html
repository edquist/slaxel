<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @blin: well, I can't explain why the link you posted with filter for GLOW doesn't show any numbers, but if I do this for May differently and search for GLOW I see accounting updated: <a href="https://accounting-next.egi.eu/wlcg/report/tier2/2017/5/2017/5/hours/">https://accounting-next.egi.eu/wlcg/report/tier2/2017/5/2017/5/hours/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:42)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> huh, maybe it's a bad label?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> can you follow up in the goc ticket? <a href="https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/33618">https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/33618</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:33)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> sure just posted there<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:55:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Good news on this front!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:57:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> We're able to send records with SSL enabled! <b>@edquist</b>, hope we can get you access sorted out soon ... could we work on wrapping up things beginning of next week? I'll ping you in private chat to coordinate few steps...<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:31)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> i'll try to set that up again<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> we need it in docker, though<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:34)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and then move on gracc production host ... we can discuss after you get an access to <a href="http://hcc-grace-itb.unl.edu">hcc-grace-itb.unl.edu</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:34:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @marian Why is it hcc-grace-itb and not gracc-itb?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, I was asking myself the same ... didn't think of it when I was seting up host ... just wanted to have common naming of hcc-grace which I think will stay for quite some time ... we can create alias gracc-itb perphaps?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:37:54)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> there is a gracc-itb.osg alias, should move that<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> true, that will happen<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:39:29)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> ah right, but gratia-osg-itb.osg is pointing at that<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:46:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, we will do later DNS alias pointer gracc-itb.opensciencegrid.org-&gt;hcc-grace-itb.unl.edu (I know, bit unfortunate I named it that way, should have been <a href="http://hcc-gracc-itb.unl.edu">hcc-gracc-itb.unl.edu</a>, but at this stage I wouldn't change it, apel staff etc is was quite a big round register properly DN cert etc ... don't want to request right away register something else)<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @kretzke - Derek is sitting in my office and we're talking about GRACC.  Which reminds me, it's time for the daily ping about moving the collector docker image to the OSG org.  Any news along those lines?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:09)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> no<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:36)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ah.  Consider yourself pinged then!<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:42)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> pong<br/>

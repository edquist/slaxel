<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @ajit Just to keep you up to date, we think we found the problem, and now formulating a solution.<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:56:21)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> @dweitzel What was the issue ?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> GPUs<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:35)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> and how the accounting was doing duplicate detection.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> may take ~1 day to get everything settled, but we have a plan<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:07)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> interesting.. we added 1 GPU server to our cluster a couple of weeks ago, and it was configured to accept CMS jobs via the osg production factory, recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:06)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> I know that Caltech, Florida, and Nebraska all have added GPU servers to their clusters in last couple of months. Wondering if the gratia accounting for those are also affected in the same way ?<br/>

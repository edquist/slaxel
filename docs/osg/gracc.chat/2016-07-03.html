<h3>Sun Jul 3, 2016 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:44)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> as an experiment I’m reindexing June into <tt>gracc.osg.raw0-2016.06</tt>. I’ve also updated the mapping, setting all TimeDuration fields to doubles (to fix that mapping error) and all _description fields (except <tt>Host_description</tt>) to analyzed strings, since in theory those could contain arbitrary text.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(10:20:35)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> are any other description fields being overloaded currently? do we want to assign <tt>Host_description</tt> to some other field for <tt>Payload</tt> records?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:12)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> could that be a permanent change for the index pattern?  And is it just for June (so, for example, May is not <tt>gracc.osg.raw0-2016-05</tt>)?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(17:30:48)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> for now just June. if that works we’ll set up aliases so you’d still go to <tt>gracc.osg.raw-*</tt><br/>

<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:16)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> not recently<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, just curious<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> and did you @dweitzel? with that subject line... I've added you to the mailing list which should be assigned to gracc ops support centre at goc system ... so trying to figure whether they switched already to that mailing list or it's still just me who gets it ...<br/>

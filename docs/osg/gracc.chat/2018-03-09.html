There are numerous high disk usage indexes that we delete after 3-7 days.  So it may be that we just had a lot of disk usage in those indexes 7 days ago, but much less now.<br/>

You can see usage by "index" (type of data) here: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/grace-elasticsearch-index-summary">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/grace-elasticsearch-index-summary</a><br/>

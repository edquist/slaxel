<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:02:41)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yes, I believe that I am, too. Did the September report actually go out?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, on Oct 4th, though. I was sending it manually, Ken received it at least, me too... Checking my inbox to see who was on the cc ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> three emails with you (<a href="mailto:cat@cs.wisc.edu">cat@cs.wisc.edu</a>) in cc:<br/><pre><br/>OSG-Connect Project Report for 2018-09-04 19:09 - 2018-10-04 19:09<br/>OSG-Direct Project Report for 2018-09-04 19:09 - 2018-10-04 19:09<br/>OSG-XD Project Report for 2018-09-04 19:09 - 2018-10-04 19:09<br/></pre><br/>or are you talking about other montly reports? ^ @cat<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, there is actually one more email with subject:<br/><pre><br/>VOs Usage of OSG Sites: 2018-09-01 00:09 - 2018-09-30 00:09<br/></pre><br/>you're not cc'd by default on that one, Brian Lin is. Do you want me add you?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:18)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I was talking about a monthly email from @kherner that he calls the monthly Site-VO Matrix. It comes as an Excel spreadsheet attachment, IIRC.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:42)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Now that I search my email, I cannot find the August report, either. @kherner did you ever send that one? Did I fall off the distribution list?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm not sure I understand "Site-VO Matrix" report which should come with Excel spreadsheet ... @sbhat, are you familiar what report Tim refers to?<br/>

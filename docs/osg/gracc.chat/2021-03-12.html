<h3>Fri Mar 12, 2021 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(06:11:18)</span> <b>duncan.macleod:</b></span> @blin, I have one more question about gracc, if you have time to answer: what job attribute does gracc use to label the 'time' of a job? [if this is all written down somewhere, please just point me in the right direction]<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:08:08)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> In htcondor, it uses the job attribute RemoteWallClockTime. Gracc multiplies it by number of processors allocated to the job, resulting in a new attribute we call CoreHours<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:11:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The gracc graphs are almost all in CoreHours<br/>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(08:28:27)</span> <b>duncan.macleod:</b></span> sorry, @dweitzel, I mean the timestamp of a job, not the run time. I'm seeing some discrepancies between our accounting and gracc on a daily timescale, but these wash out when I zoom out, so I presume it's just a difference in how a job is matched to a calendar day<br/>
<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(08:31:14)</span> <b>duncan.macleod:</b></span> (it is reassuring however to know what we both seem to be measuring core hours in the same way)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:44:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, all jobs are binned on the EndTime to the day. So if a job finished at 2am and another at 10pm (UTC) they would be aggregated together as happening at 00:00:00 on the same day. <br/>

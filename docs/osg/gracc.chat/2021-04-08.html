<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @ajit could you confirm that the numbers now look good on the EGI accounting site: <a href="https://accounting.egi.eu/osg/">https://accounting.egi.eu/osg/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> They seem updated to me now.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:46:20)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> the delay between submitting the numbers and showing up on the dashboard must be between 24-48 hours.<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:24:14)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> @dweitzel yes, the numbers now look ok in the EGI portal. The person who responded to your GGUS ticket mentioned that it might take a couple of weeks to get the March numbers corrected. So, it's either ~48 hours delay or someone else intervened on the EGI side.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:24:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I suspect itâ€™s the long delay. <br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:25:54)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> But last time when you corrected the GLOW numbers (due to GPU issue) and pushed it to EGI, those numbers got updated within a couple of hours on the portal (I had verified that)<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:27:49)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> I have a script that tracks daily changes to GLOW numbers on the portal, and warns in case of no changes.<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:30:06)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> But the script ran into issues and stopped working for 2 weeks in March, and I didn't notice that (due to other major distractions)..<br/>
<span style="color: #e475df"><span style="font-size: small">(17:31:58)</span> <b>ajit:</b></span> For now, it's good. Thanks for taking care of the issue.<br/>

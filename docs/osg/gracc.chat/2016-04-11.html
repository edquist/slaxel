<h3>Mon Apr 11, 2016 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:23)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> The good news is GRACC has been processing records for the past week without problem. The bad news it’s because I changed to using RabbitMQ on Fermicloud. I opened an issue in Jira to look into it <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC-1">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC-1</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Hi Kevin.  I’m not sure who to bug at the GOC about this, but you may be better served with a GOC ticket.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:57)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Since they manage the rabbitmq service.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:00)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> yeah, wasn’t sure the best route for that, but the Jira issue is for me to look into it more<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ok, sounds good.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> some GOC people are on Jira, I could ping them.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:20)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(21:53:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Particularly - I think Soichi knows the most about the GOC RabbitMQ.  If you file a ticket, try to get him CC’d.  I believe he’s best-effort-only right now — officially transitioned to non-OSG projects at IU.  But he’s typically quite gracious (gratiaous?) in helping out.<br/>

<h3>Tue Dec 19, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:35)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> GRACC is now running on a new Frontend.  Please be aware.  We need to add @kretzke and @sbhat SSH keys still.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:19:22)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I was looking over it with @marian yesterday. Some dashboards need to be fixed from a breaking change in Elasticsearch (min_doc_count=0 not allowed). Making *any* change to the broken panels fixes the query at least. Maybe a batch import/export from the API would work too.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Marian did this last night, he seems to have fixed it.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:38)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> still a few broken ones<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, some may still be broken ... point me to the link and we'll fix... fixing as we come to them ... or if you want just do a change and save in dashboard<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:51)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kretzke, @sbhat: your accounts should work again ... beware you have empty home dir on new FE, by purpose atm ... all what you had in home is on <tt><a href="http://hcc-gracc.unl.edu">hcc-gracc.unl.edu</a></tt> (now old FE) instead of <tt><a href="http://gracc.opensciencegrid.org">gracc.opensciencegrid.org</a></tt> (new FE)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:23)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> thanks! BTW Iâ€™ve closed all the FIFE indices, want to make one more check before deleting them<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:23)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> thanks!<br/>

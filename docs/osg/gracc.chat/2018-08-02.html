<h3>Thu Aug 2, 2018 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> shreyas, i think this was covered in the PR but I was hoping to see the change done in the 'days' time frame<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:15)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but it sounded like @marian would be able to apply the config change manually in the meantime?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I've added it yesterday and restarted docker with gracc-request for that<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian so i should be able to see changes tomorrow?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:18:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (on a meeting now, can take a look later how often it should resummarize things etc, maybe @dweitzel knows right away?)<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:15)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> I think Derek already made the changes as well<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:34)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> so it'll be in the new RPM whenever that's cut - and in the meantime, Marian's change should hold<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:46)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> my understanding is that you should be able to see the changes tomorrow<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:59)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> because the summarizer has a caching mechanism as well<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:15)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> I'd have assumed that with the docker container restart, it'd go ahead and download the new file<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:30)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> probably my bad, I haven't restarted with new change on the  Frontend we've switched to last week due ceph maintenance here ... I'll fix it on hcc-gracc2 now<br/>

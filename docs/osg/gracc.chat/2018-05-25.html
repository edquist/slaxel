<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:18)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @marian Installing new version of gracc-request on gracc.  It uses the new <a href="http://my.opensciencegrid.org">my.opensciencegrid.org</a>.  Let me know if you see any issues.  If things go wrong, you may see a lot of N/A, or Unknown for Field of science or facilities.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Good to know, thanks for heads up. Should I report back to you or can I do something with it then?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'm not sure what you mean @marian.  The install is done.  I watched it through a couple of iterations, and everything looks good.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Just asking if I should do something about N/A when it shows up or itâ€™s just something temporary that can be ignored<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:17:16)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, if N/A or Unknown shows up, notify me.<br/>

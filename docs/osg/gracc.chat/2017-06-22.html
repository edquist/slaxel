<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> &gt; hi @dweitzel do you have a gracc view for contributions (core hours) from institutions to the OSG for all time?<br/>&gt; “Site Summary ” in GRACC doesn’t seem to have that<br/>&gt; e.g. “show me all the institutions from the state of PA that are contributing cycles to science using the OSG”<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:39)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> hello!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> hi<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:25:37)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> in future, realize its not practical now given OIM schema site schema, etc, but would like to get views to answer two questions relevant to campus resource providers.  “Which institutions are contributing to the OSG?”  and, “which/who of my faculty (at my institution) are using the OSG”<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:37)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> the first serves as an incentive for campuses — “ah, so-and-so are on the OSG, its probably secure, we should be too”<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:09)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> the second helps research computing directors understand who on campus depends on the OSG for their research<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:43)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> however we can wrangle data to address these questions is okay<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:01)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> site names (e.g. MWT2) are generally useless<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:16)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> We do have this: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/payload-jobs-summary?panelId=15&amp;fullscreen&amp;orgId=1">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/payload-jobs-summary?panelId=15&amp;fullscreen&amp;orgId=1</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> That's who is using the OSG.<br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:49)</span> <b>rwg:</b></span> thats excellent<br/>

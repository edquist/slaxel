<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:09)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> Hi Derek (@dweitzel) - do i understand it right that  Comet is reported as a part of UCSD pledge to WLCG central accounting (converted to HS06)? Or the procedure has changed?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:02)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I just checked.  Nope, it is not reported as part of the UCSD pledge.  The usage is sent up as the site "CometVirtualCluster", which as far as I know is not registered in EGI / CRIC.  So the usage is just dropped.<br/>

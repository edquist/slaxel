<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:05:01)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @marian @jthiltges @huijun.zhu did you see the <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-0/">grafana 8 announcement</a>?  Some features sound pretty useful:<br/>• Alerting integration with Prometheus.  May force us to re-think alerting, but that's probably ok.<br/>• Library panels.  Panels shared between dashboards that can be updated centrally.<br/>

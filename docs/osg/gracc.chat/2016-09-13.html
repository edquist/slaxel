<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:20:53)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> That's correct - CMS doesn't send payload information to Gratia. It's certainly doable (that's basically what we do for the CMS Kibana instance) - just no one has bothered.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, that’s fine.  As long as I know that, I can mention it during the meeting.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:11)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @kretzke does the google or github authentication work with grafana?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:10)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> google does<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:30)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> users can also sign up for a local account. only advantage of signing in is setting personal preferences and starring dashboards. of course once someone has an account an admin can give them roles to create and edit dashboards<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:55)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> there’s also a “Read-only editor” role that allows changing dashboards, but not saving them, basically for playing around with the data. maybe signed-in users should get that role by default<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:55)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> like they can change the queries as a “read-only editor”?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:01)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> because you can already set the filters.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:47)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> right, it would only be useful for power users who want to look at something new<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yeah.  not really our target audience, I suppose.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:36)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :wink: grafana ain't Miron-pretty yet.  We still need to tweak the spacing and coloring.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:16)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Architecture via jumbles of arrows - I like it!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> "Two orders of magnitude ought to be enough for anyone"<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:35:50)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> And Gratia was Miron-pretty?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> we had an incredible number of round trips with Miron about the graphs.... about a decade ago.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:55)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I feel like we need a Miron equivalent of <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:47)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Maybe this is a question for @tanya , but who is writing and creating the poster for CHEP?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:57)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> also, is anyone here attending, other than Brian and Myself?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:42)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I am not. Tanya’s on vacation this week<br/>

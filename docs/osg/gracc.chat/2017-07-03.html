<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, do we have anything else to report besides these to tickets:<br/><a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34346">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34346</a><br/><a href="https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34179">https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/34179</a><br/>It's for GOC Operations meeting starting now...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:20)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> We need that host cert!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> it's in GOC's court now.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, follow up with them on the meeting too<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so did you run request from that host right?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:29)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yup<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> the hostkey is in ~root/host-cert-request directory<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I hope you are able to get the cert, and it isn't just tied to me.  I am going to be heading off for the next couple days here in an hour or so.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:24:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> alright, I'll take care of it ...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:33)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, I just got it.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:37)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> took care of everything.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:42)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> backups are now successful.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:46)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> cool<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> just talked to Tom he approved request<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:53)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> You can go ahead ane make sure everything looks good.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> host certs are in place though.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:40)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> and here is the check_mk all green emails.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> btw, it wasn't Nebraska's grid admins last time who issued this cert, otherwise we should have noticed soon enough as we monitor what is issued by our grid admins (Garhan or Carl)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:58)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> No. I think it was Kevin. <br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, and he is out this week... anyway, next time it'll be you who gets notified unless we're able to change contact email address to the cert ... I asked Tom if that's possible<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:23)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's why preferably next time we ask our Nebraskan's grid admins to issue the cert as we have notifications like this pretty well monitored whenever they issue certs ... noted<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:16)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Actually, it would be great to have check_mk monitor the time left on the cert. <br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:18:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, we could do that just for gracc host as part of ops ... I was more thinking whether our grid admins use something central already that we don't have to ping them about expiration since it's anyway them to reissue cert in the future<br/>

<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:15)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Hey all -- I noticed today that the stats for my clusters has gone down to zero in GRACC since the 8th.  It seems gratia-probes-cron may have run into issues on both of my CE's, so I've restarted it.  Is there anything special I need to do to ensure the backlog of stats gets transferred?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:48)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Nope, nothing special<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> gracc was in an odd state until this morning.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It should be catching up now.<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:59)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @ian_cancercomputer GRACC should be mostly caught up now.  Let me know if you see anything missing<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:20)</span> <b>ian_cancercomputer:</b></span>  Thanks @dweitzel !  All looks good so far as I can tell.  I would have to grep the logs to confirm no BioGraph jobs have been scheduled but otherwise the results seem right.<br/>

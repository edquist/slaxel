<h3>Wed Jun 6, 2018 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:28)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Can you keep track of resource groups/resources/sites across renames? E.g. there's a site called "brown-cms-new" with an RG and a resource also called "brown-cms-new" and they're not new<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It depends on a lot of factors.  We "match" the resource by either the ProbeName (which is something like condor:&lt;fqdn&gt;), or if the "SiteName" matches the resource group...<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> also AFAICT Brown doesn't have any data in GRACC?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> oh, then it doesn't matter.<br/>

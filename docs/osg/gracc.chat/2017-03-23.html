<h3>Thu Mar 23, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:38)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> well, we haven't had nearly as many gracc failures recently.  So it's getting better!<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:02)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> hi, any progress with @marian Fermilab travel plans?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:25)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> @dweitzel failures in what way? same overnight issues happened last night at 3:18 and the night before at 4:53<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:58)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> difference now is services are getting restarted, but it’s still a problem that they’re getting killed<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:39)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I saw the issue last night, but then I didn't see anything tuesday.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> and it was good all weekend.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> hi, no travel plans to FNAL for me, talked to Brian two days ago about it - me and Keving should establish some online Slack conference or Zoom or whatever ... Just haven't contacted Kevin about it yet, dealing with quite some number of spinning plates after AHM and week of vacation...<br/>

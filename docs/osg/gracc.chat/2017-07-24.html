<h3>Mon Jul 24, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:53)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> does anyone have better clue what this ticket is about? <a href="https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC-123">https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC-123</a><br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:51)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> Those come from the Probe reports from the gracc-reporting suite<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:27)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> there was some back-and-forth between Tanya and the GOC folks about these - I'm not sure what got decided on<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:45)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> but iirc, we didn't see these as "false positives", but misconfigurations in OIM<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:54)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> let me take a look at the emails...<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:06)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> or if @tanya remembers, she could weigh in<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:30)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> it looks like certain sites that get flagged (like NERSC, UFlorida, and BNL) shouldn't have tickets created for them...but where that's controlled was never decided on it looks like.  Certainly the report doesn't do that.<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:25)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> i remember only about Florida;<br/>
<span style="color: #902d59"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:00)</span> <b>tanya:</b></span> you could have “black list” but I think the better approach is to work with the sites and fix it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> is there actually anything to fix then on a site if these are "false positives"?<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:58)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> they're not really "false positives"<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:01)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> basically, the report looks for all the hostnames in OIM that are attached to active resources (and some other filters I can't remember off the top of my head), and sees if a probe with that same FQAN has sent records in the past two days<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:12)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> if not, it sends an email to GOC<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:58)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> so if there's some resource registered on OIM, and the probe isn't on that hostname, it will show up as not reporting records.  I think that's what's happened here, but I'm not entirely sure<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, alright, that gives me a clue now, at least!<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so it seem to me then OSG SW needs to get in touch with a site and help them fix non-running or misconfigured probe, not a GRACC Ops ... I guess?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:30:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> though, this is all about gracc-reporting ... uhm<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:00)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I just want to understand what to do ... because if we report to site this is happening I don't have an answer how to fix their config issue if they have any with a probe<br/>

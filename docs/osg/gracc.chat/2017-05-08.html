<h3>Mon May 8, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not sure if related, but looks like we have trouble with apel reports to be sent from May 3rd ... there is another email thread open with APEL folks ... <b>@edquist</b>: can you check your report uploads works to Indiana jump shared folder? I'll be on the GOC Ops phone call in about hour so I may ask if all is OK with Indiana mechanism sending apel report...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Indiana mechanism will be checked after the GOC Ops  meeting, Scott will reply to the issue about missing reports I mentioned... @kretzke, I'm not sure about zeros for April in the link you referenced...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:24:15)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> as reference what Derek just sent around the gracc-project mailing list accounting report includes numbers, though ...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @kretzke - could you send the various operational git gists as PRs to the StashCache repos?  Easier to track that way...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Also, did you get a chance to automate the build for the collector Docker images?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:23)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @bbockelm I assume you mean to the GRACC documentation repo?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:06:40)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ugh.  That one too.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:07:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face: Marian and I just had our touch-base about GRACC and StashCache.  Apparently my brain context-switched one time too many.  Or one time too few?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:11:04)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> @bbockelm aye. collector docker image will have to be generated by CI, havenâ€™t had a chance to look at it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I have a new build of gracc-request and gracc-summary agents.  Usually, I would run these on the ITB instance for a few days.  @marian is the ITB instance in a state where I could run these agents and test?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> what does it require? machine is up, but I haven't configure nginx etc yet ... shouldn't be too much work, though ... could we work on that tomorrow?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Sure.  Then we can configure it to work on the ITB RabbitMQ and the ITB records.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:46)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <b>@edquist</b> - did you see Marian's items above?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:31)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @bbockelm - I think <b>@edquist</b> just replied to the email saying his reports are sent just fine, if I understood correctly ... so ball is again on Scotts field<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:04)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Ah - yes, I saw that.  I was more worried about having him pick up the responsibility of getting the SSM script working on the ITB (like we discussed) so you can free up to work on the various other GRACC tasks.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, ok ... can get him access to ITB, no problem ... there are things installed to test sending reports via SSM etc ... but I thought we want to get working mechanism from Scott, too ... if he can share ... instead of writing own SSM generator ... this unique file names and directories seem to me weird design for this purpose, but probably I don't see behind the curtains there so hard to judge ...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:17)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Can you poke Scott directly and CC Rob Quick?  Scott might not understand the priority here.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:08)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'll write new email cc you, Carl and Rob<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:33:59)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> sorry i was not on slack earlier today - just saw all your messages<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:36:00)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> yeah as far as i can tell the reports are getting generated and scp'd to the shared fs at iu via jump, as described in my email; it looks like the machinery on Scott's side is consuming it; i'm not sure what gives<br/>
<span style="color: #16569E"><span style="font-size: small">(18:36:12)</span> <b>edquist:</b></span> as for me taking over the SSM script stuff, i'm happy to do whatever as long as you guys keep @blin in the loop<br/>

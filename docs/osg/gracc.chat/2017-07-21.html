<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:26:10)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi, any further direction for this one? <a href="https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/34181">https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/34181</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @dweitzel: what you think, shall we remove 'by user' thing from the dashboard then as Shreyas suggests?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:58)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> it probably really doesn't give much useful info since majority "by user" plots gives N/A ... looking at the link: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/payload-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;from=now-60d&amp;to=now&amp;var-VOName=All&amp;var-Project=All&amp;var-Facility=All&amp;var-User=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/payload-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;from=now-60d&amp;to=now&amp;var-VOName=All&amp;var-Project=All&amp;var-Facility=All&amp;var-User=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=1d</a> ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:38:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> though, that doesn't solve thing about CN vs DN ... still makes things look more nicer as having lot of N/A<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yeah, it doesn't show anything useful now. Delete the graphs for now is my vote. <br/>

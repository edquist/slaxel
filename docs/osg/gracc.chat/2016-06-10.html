<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:17)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> started testing reprocessing osg-itb records. with batch size of 1000 reprocessor+collector hitting around 300 Hz (2s to fetch records + 1s to process through collector)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:42)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> however, the gracc-raw agent seems to be averaging about 100 Hz inserting records. not clear if the bottleneck is the agent or elasticsearch<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:34:23)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> I don’t immediately see any indications of system performance being a limitation<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:17)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> hm, with batch size 500 maintaining over 350 Hz<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:28)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Are we doing that flush every 5 seconds stuff?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:13)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> yes, I’ll try changing that and see if it makes an impact. index refresh interval was increased to 60s however<br/>

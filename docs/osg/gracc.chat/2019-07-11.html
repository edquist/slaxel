<h3>Thu Jul 11, 2019 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> hey folks, the projects xml file in topology (<a href="https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/miscproject/xml">https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/miscproject/xml</a>) was broken overnight. did it affect anything?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:36)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not that I'm aware of, at least<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I think gracc reports don't use it on daily basis rather than weekly, other things that could use it I'm not aware of, @matyas<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian as part of the taskforce it'd be good to figure out where project data is coming from/how it's validated in the records<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and adding what we find here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHMaYnU5mHaBPmias7J6QWCuL9IpLF5PXtRlWuDannU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tHMaYnU5mHaBPmias7J6QWCuL9IpLF5PXtRlWuDannU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i mention it because it's not really clear to me why we register projects in topology -- i assume the GRACC is querying it somehow<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:56)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i just wonder why it doesn't query Globus directly since that's what i believe the research facilitation team uses for OSG Connect anyway<br/>

<h3>Fri Aug 25, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kretzke: if one choose date interval in gracc the end date you click on the calendar sets it to one day after ... and it always sets from 5 o'clock to 4:49 o'clock ... any reasonable logic behind it?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:18)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> logic, yes, reasonable, maybe not: it’s adjusting for UTC offset<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:50:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> maybe silly question, is this configurable? I'd not mind if we simply set start do clicked day at 0:00 o'clock and when you set end date it sticks with that date and 23:59 ... that way we at least match nicely APEL monthly report versus GRACC... that's at least CPU consumption ... not sure if we should do it that way but we eliminate people's questions like things do not match against WLCG reporting...<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:18)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> no, it’s probably hardcoded in some javascript library<br/>

<h3>Wed Feb 7, 2018 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> <b>@channel</b> (hopefully) short interruption GRACC FE - scheduled reboot, updated kernel and packages (no update to ES, kibana, grafana)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I counted about up to 20mins we had no plots available ... error on the system site, <tt>/var/run/elasticsearch-ro</tt> directory wasn't recreated and <tt>elasticsearch-ro.service</tt> failed to start ... besides that I haven't noticed issues with other services which didn't come back up normal (besides check_mk which flips on/off right now but that's not gracc service malfunction)<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> still, if anybody see anything of suspect on the gracc web let me know<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> with figuring out <tt>/var/run/elasticsearch-ro</tt> missing erlier or having it in place downtime should have been just the reboot itself until all is back, i.e. ~5mins max<br/>

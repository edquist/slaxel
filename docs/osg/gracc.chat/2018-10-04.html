<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:30)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Going back through my emails, I don't think I got the usual monthly site-VO matrix report.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:40)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Did it in fact go out on the first?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:32:06)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Hi Ken, good question... We've been switching to the new Frontend, but reports usually go out on Monday ... I'll check what happened<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:55)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I asked Shreyas but he said the reports had been moved somewhere that he can't access.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, talking to him now... sorry for the inconvenience<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner, reports should be fixed and I launched manually monthly ones ... sorry for the trouble with it!<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:33)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Thanks much<br/>

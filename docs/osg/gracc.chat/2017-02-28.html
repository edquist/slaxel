<h3>Tue Feb 28, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:25)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> Where does the Gracc name for the facility come from?  Is it from the gratia probe name?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:20)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> @sthapa OIM. It tries to match the site reported by the probe to a resource (and/or resource group I think), or tries matching the probe name to a resource FQDN (for Batch records)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:22)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> for Payload records it uses the Host description, again trying to match a resource in OIM<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(13:33:34)</span> <b>sbhat:</b></span> right - For Batch, it tries to use the Probe Name in the gracc record and match it to an FQDN registered to a resource in OIM.  If that doesn't work, it'll try to match the SiteName to the OIM Resource<br/>

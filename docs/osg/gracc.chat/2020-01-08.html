<h3>Wed Jan 8, 2020 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:39)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Hi all, I didn't the the usual end-of-month GRACC reports on January 1. Did something get stuck?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:45)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Indeed, I don't see anything since Dec. 1 @marian ?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ugh, checking...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:02)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kherner... should be OK, whenever cluster health is &lt;100% it fails to connect to elasticsearch ... cluster had one unassigned shard thus health was down to 99.99% which caused reports to fail<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:12)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I resent manually the monthly one<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:37)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> others will come from cron next time unless somebody wants me to run rest of it...<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:09)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @marian Thanks; I'll be on the lookout for it.<br/>

<h3>Mon Jun 5, 2017 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @kretzke: looks like <a href="http://hcc-grace.unl.edu">hcc-grace.unl.edu</a> hostcert expired ... there is bunch of certs in grid-security area, do you recall which are may be duplicates of expired one and need immediate attention to replace as well?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:27)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> is hcc-grace cert being used for anything?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:20)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> I’m confused by some gracc reporting.  Looking at <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/osg-connect-summary-osg-connect?orgId=1">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/osg-connect-summary-osg-connect?orgId=1</a> , it says 4.4 million cpu hours but looking at the plot and based on historical info, this should be closer to 1M .  Do you know what happened?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:53)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> There was maintenance on the osg connect submit nodes so that might have caused misreporting<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The project name information at the bottom looks like it adds up to 4.4 million.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> thought you'd know better if there would be anything to worry about ... feeling better if you don't think there is any issue with that hostcert ... just quite number of certs still exist in /etc/grid-security/ ... will be cleaning up when redeploying<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:59)</span> <b>sthapa:</b></span> but the wall hours per 1d has a peak at 300k .  That puts the weekly consumption at 2.1M for the week.  There’s some sort of discrepancy between the numbers<br/>

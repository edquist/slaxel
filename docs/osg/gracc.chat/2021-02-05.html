<h3>Fri Feb 5, 2021 : #gracc (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(07:57:50)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> GRACC is now fully updated.  Kibana is updated (and once again, changed it's appearance slightly), as well as grafana (no apparent changes).  As always, let us know if you see anything that looks wrong or odd.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:58)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I see something a little odd in the UI — we’re meeting at 10, so I can show you in Zoom then. No immediate action needed.<br/>

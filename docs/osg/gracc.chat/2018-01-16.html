<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:40)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> anyone else notice that the URL shortener in kibana is working without login? <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/864456137ecc85d3e2be6e2f6f9ae654">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/864456137ecc85d3e2be6e2f6f9ae654</a> is that from an update to the ReadOnlyRest plugin?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @kretzke it could very well be.  We did update everything when we made the new frontend.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c8c69"><span style="font-size: small">(17:48:19)</span> <b>kretzke:</b></span> well it still is blocking deletes and such, so yay! that was a request I put in to the plugin maintainers over a year ago I think. Makes it so much better when sharing Kibana graphs!<br/>

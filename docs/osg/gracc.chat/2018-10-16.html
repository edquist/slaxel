<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:21:11)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @marian i believe @cat is referring to the <tt>VOs Usage of OSG Sites</tt> report, please add him to the CC<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:43)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> No, I am *not* talking about being added to a new report.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:35)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> BTW @cat I sent the August one but not September yet.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:38)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @kherner at least used to send a monthly email to the OSG Executive Team, entitled “Site-VO matrix for [month] [year]”<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:06)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Should be later today once I fix a few other things<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:30)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hm, I cannot find the August one. Could you send it again at least to me?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:02:18)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yeah, the last one that I can find in my email history is “Site-VO matrix for July 2018”<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:03:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> hrm, didn't realize there was a difference. i believe all of our prior discussions about N/A sites were based off the <tt>VOs Usage of OSG Sites</tt> report<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:32)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> What format is that report in? Email? Online at GRACC? …?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> email, it looks exactly like the reports you've forwarded me in the past with VOs across the top and sites down the side<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but i guess like shreyas said, ken does some manual modifications for the report he sends to the ET?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:57)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yes, it's the same info, just slightly dressed up and in excel format<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:29:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Is it just my slow internet, or does <a href="http://gracc.opensciencegrid.org">gracc.opensciencegrid.org</a> take a while to initially load?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> maybe a little slow but not terribly so?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:33:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, "not terribly slow" is good enough for me.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:27)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> GRACC has been plenty speedy for me today.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Speedy is great!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:41:15)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> (I will be inserting these into a yelp like reviews :slightly_smiling_face: )<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:06)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> It does seem to be generally faster recently.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:59:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> That's good.  It is a newer version, maybe better optimized?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:44)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Quite possible. Just now, the first page I loaded was indeed a little slow. Everything else though has been very fast, even pages I didn't have any cache for.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:31)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I wonder if it was just a matter of pulling in the newer version stuff and updating older caches in my case. It's completely fine now.<br/>

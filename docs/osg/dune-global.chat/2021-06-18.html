<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:55:42)</span> <b>macosta:</b></span> After a long battle with GWMS tokens, the Global Pool is now in full service, with the Frontend talking to both local and BNL schedds and submitting pilot requests to the factory<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(11:58:19)</span> <b>macosta:</b></span> Will submit more jobs to keep the infrastructure going. If anyone has a workflow to help test this out, let me know (if at FNAL) or @xzhao (if at BNL) so we can get you access to the corresponding condor Schedd<br/>

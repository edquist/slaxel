<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:48)</span> <b>mtiernan:</b></span> I opened my mouth/keyboard and asked about a Slack channel about perfSONAR. So, here it is. The conversation included this sentiment from me:<br/>I’d actually make a case that it *should NOT* be for “real-time” support.<br/><br/>It should be a method allowing participants [who are] working on a problem [to] interact at their leisure in a different format than email. (Which has it’s limits.)<br/><br/>It also might help build (I should say ‘foster’) a “community” feeling of interaction.<br/>[…]<br/>
<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:27)</span> <b>mtiernan:</b></span> I hope this meets with everyone’s approval.<br/>

<h3>Wed Oct 28, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:26)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> @lmichael I owned a ticket from Aaron Bergstrom to you <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65951">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65951</a> after letting him know you were out for the morning that that he'll hear from you soon<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:57:54)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah. I had triggered that one as a split from an existing ticket, but only hit send on my reply just now. Thanks, and sorry for the confusion while Iâ€™m juggling some things today.<br/>

<h3>Mon Oct 28, 2019 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(07:46:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm on travel and will not be able to make the call today<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Thanks, Mats.<br/>I will need to skip to work on the OSG FoCaS proposal (probably meeting with others at that time). For @cbrown58 @christinalk @emelie, can you see where we are on Documentation (and given recent notes in our meeting doc) and work together on a bunch of input for the UChicago team regarding the new user management website?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:38)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Miron and Todd were in India last week, and I see that we have quite a few account requests from @*.in addresses, so I’ve asked them (and Frank) if we should proceed any differently than our default (turning away non-US requests). Go ahead and send the first response (“do you have a US affiliation”),  but await further input!<br/>

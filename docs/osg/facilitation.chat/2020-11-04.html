<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:54:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @jmvera Are you on triage duty today? If you get an account request from Soonwon Choi, please pass it to me<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:27)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> yes, and will do!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:10)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:45)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> @rynge Soonwon's request just came in <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65996">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65996</a><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:11)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> a third one? :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> He really wanted the username from the first one. Turns our that username is a primary key in the db, so it could not be easily changed. I had Lincoln delete the 2 first requests, and had the user submit a third request with the right institutional login + username combination<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> lol. Itâ€™s very nice of us (you and Lincoln!) to accommodate!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I told Lincoln that we will only spend 10 minutes on it before giving up! But it is good to know that this works<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:27:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Indeed!<br/>

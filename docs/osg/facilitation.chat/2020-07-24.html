<h3>Fri Jul 24, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:52)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> I’ve reviewed AutoDock and Blast (did 1 PR for the Blast tutorial).  What have we decided for Python?  It will require more extensive edits I think.  @christinalk<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:06)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> We could maybe do the R-addlib example instead?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think that’s more recent.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:32)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> I’ll take a look.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:33)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Any remaining todos for Monday’s tutorial, @christinalk?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think we need an early slide (or instructions on the website) on how we will use Zoom during the tutorial<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ways of users to ask questions (raising hands?) and how the breakout helping rooms will work<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:33)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We can talk about it while users are requesting accounts<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:16:09)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I have not run a Zoom meeting like that so I don't feel qualified to provide the instructions<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:37)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @cbrown58 if you want to review + customize/modify the opening slide deck, that would be great<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:03)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> especially if you can add a slide incorporating @rynge suggestions<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:12)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I have some existing Zoom logistic slides ill add in<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:18)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> perfect. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:25)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Otherwise, when I looked through it it seemed pretty comprehensive. If there's something else that anyone thinks I should add to it though let me know.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:49)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think the main thing is whether any of you have questions about the format/what we’re doing<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:01)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> How are we planning to use the breakout rooms btw?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:17)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm curious what kind of audience we will end up with. Should we maybe have a poll or two when we wait for people to get accounts?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:52)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Good idea.  It's easiest to set up polls ahead of time in zoom. Which we can't do. So perhaps we should use some Google forms for that<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Well, I don't want to create work right before...<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:16)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:38)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The breakout rooms will be interesting - I assume we will have to use them if somebody get stuck<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:23)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Based on our experience and previous workshops, sometimes it's easiest to diagnose problems via chat in the main room if possible. That way the people attending can continue to listen and don't fall behind.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ah, ok<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:38)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> However, break out rooms are good in more severe situations where the learner will need to share their screen<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> One-on-one chat?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:48)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok, so they will ask a question in the main chat, and one of us helpers will take it from there?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:13)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I was planning to use breakout rooms for the hands-on pieces<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:25)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I guess we can use this room to coordinate between us<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:30)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Ahh ok. Are we going to assign them then?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:55)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think so.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:03)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’ll add that to the schedule spreadsheet<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:08)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Ok<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:24)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> If anybody has any poll questions they want to use, let me know. I can set up a pre and post poll if we want.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We have a post poll already (survey)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:19)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> there will be two post polls - the one I made + the official PEARC one<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:25)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> suggestions to mine are GREATLY welcomed. :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:27)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Ahh ok<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:32)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I'll take a look!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:19)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> but putting together either a pre-survey or have people put where they’re from in a google doc or doing something like mentimeter sounds good<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:02)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I was going to use a document to consolidate all of the location results, so we can incorporate an introduction/sign in sheet into that<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:15)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Christina beat me to that :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Where they are from, and maybe their role? I suspect we will have a mix of facilitators, users, resource providers, ...<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:46)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Is this fine-grained enough Mats?<br/><pre>Resource Provider: <br/>Systems-facing professional: <br/>Researcher-facing professional: <br/>End User / Researcher: </pre><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:52)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Or should we include additional options?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think that is fine<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:24:04)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Since hand raising functionality changes between various Zoom instances, and I’m not sure they’ll have it activated, I am leaving it off the slides for now, but we can talk about it at the beginning of the talks. I did add a setup slide though that we can use as a check to ensure everyone has accounts that work.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:25:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Great! Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I also fixed that scaling up issue on the website<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I was hoping to do a case study discussion for part 2, where I present a researcher profile + have people ask questions<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:52)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> would people <b>@here</b> be comfortable facilitating a discussion about this?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:08)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Can you elaborate more on what kind of discussion you’re expecting? Are you thinking just a presentation of a typical use case and have the attendees discuss how OSG would be applicable?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:03)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> If yes, I’d be happy to.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:26:09)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’d be happy ‘posing as the researcher’ or otherwise representing the HTC use case, if that’s what you mean. Is there else anything I need to do besides show up and take directions from the rest of you? :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:58)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I though that we could do a model w/ Lauren as researcher + all of us asking questions + then split off into breakout groups with a case study kind of like this: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1no1P8O2uw9ex1LDrk4Ff8C3TMDRc5bB5lKw7pDX_PLs/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1no1P8O2uw9ex1LDrk4Ff8C3TMDRc5bB5lKw7pDX_PLs/edit</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> wouldn’t have to role play - I think we could just guide discussion and provide feedback. I would give more information to us as the leaders of the discussion.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:48)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> the email was sent! @rynge get ready for incoming accounts. :smile:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:02)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Cool!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk where did we get the list of registrants that we used to email people and tell them to request accounts? The people showing up in the schedule (on the PEARC website) are NOT necessarily registered for the tutorial or even for the conference. The schedule tool just allows you publicly indicate that you are interested. It’s a big mess, and I’ve got people contacting me asking to be added because they thought adding themselves to the website schedule was enough...and didn’t even register for the conference.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:16)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I told Kim to only email people who had registered for our tutorial<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:10:36)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> so I assume it only went to them?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:11:56)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> the whole reason she had to send it was because she couldn’t give us the email addresses (privacy) so I think it would be the actual registration, not people in brella<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> This is all weird. Apparently there are several people who added themselves to the tutorial listing on the website schedule and had no idea they needed to pay, now asking to be added to the tutorial. Can I tell the organizers we will take them? Some are CC*, and I generally like to reward those who go out of their way to even ask.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:02)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I mean, I’m a little worried about numbers, but yes, I think we could take a few more people.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:17:24)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> someone else emailed us individually - should we allow them as well?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> forward to me? I don’t want to be doing this all weekend, and increasing our numbers to an unmanageable situation.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:21:09)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> like, literally, people thought ‘registering’ themselves with a schedule profile was all they needed to do for the conference registration (reasonable, if you’re not experienced with PEARC or the website). I hate the schedule layout on the PEARC20 website to begin with, but this …<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:31:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> are we planning to record the session?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:33:42)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I had not thought about it, but would be open.<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> In any case, let’s acknowledge that this is our first virtual training with this material, and that we have more people in the room than planned, so that the audience might bear with us.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:34:52)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Oh that’s going to happen for sure! disclaimers all over the place couched as “your feedback will be valuable to us”. :smile:<br/>

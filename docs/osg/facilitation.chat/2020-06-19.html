<h3>Fri Jun 19, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:04)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I met with Thanh Nguyen today from Rowen University. However, there is already a Rowan_Nguyen project owned by Hieu Nguyen. Any suggestions on how I should name this new project? Rowan_NguyenT? @christinalk @lmichael<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:51)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Different faculty?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:08)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think <tt>Rowan_NguyenT</tt> makes sense<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:29:39)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes, different department even. But this is probably not the last time we’ll encounter a situation with two faculty at the same institution with the same last name, so it would be good to establish a standard.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:25)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Rowan_ThanhNguyen is what I would go with<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> or Rowan_TNguyen<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, maybe the word is spreading through Rowen University?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:40:51)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes, he stated one of his collegues told him about OSG. so I am guessing it’s the other Nguyen :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:41:11)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Unfortunately, I already created it under Rowan_NguyenT….is there a way to change it?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:54)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I’m going to proceed so the user can get up and running. If desired, it looks like I can delete the existing project and create a new one. Let me know if its worth the effort.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> My vote would be for lastname_firstname, so I feel like you could leave it. @lmichael any particular reason for firstname or initial first?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> just at-a-glance recognition<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:02:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (which is why we’ve gone with Institution_LastName, in the first place)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> If they haven’t run ‘connect project’, yet, you can still change it, @cbrown58 (in the web back-end and in topology) with no problems<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:55)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> According to Chris, it’s not possible to change the Unix name. i can still delete and recreate if desired.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> nah<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(08:37:23)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @cbrown58 I stole the Penfeng Li ticket - he already has an account but has changed institutions<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:37:35)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Oh ok. Thanks for the heads up!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:14)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> no worries. I had another thread going with him so I can just continue the conversation. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:32:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk @rynge Should Brookhaven/EIC people use a bnl submit point rather than OSG Connect? I talked with another user for whom that was the right route, but their local support hadn’t been really clear on it. <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65444">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65444</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think they should use the BNL submit point<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:40)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Xin Zhao is the contact<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> next steps?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:55)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think I gave my last brookhaven researcher Xin Zhao’s email (which I have to dig up) and told them to contact them?<br/>

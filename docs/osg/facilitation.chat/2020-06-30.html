<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:08)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I have a ticket where 20% of a user's jobs are going on hold with the following message: <tt>Job in status 2 put on hold by SYSTEM_PERIODIC_HOLD due to memory usage 5982956. Code 26 Subcode 0</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(09:51:11)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I assume it's due to exceeded memory request/allocation but this is different that the hold reason message that we get at CHTC so I wanted to check first<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yes, that’s over-memory hold<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge what is the 5982956 about? Is this your implementation of the pool-wide holds? (The hold reason is a bit cryptic, so wondering if we can do better)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, that just means they are going over memory. The 5982956 is just the memory usage when the rule triggered<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:01)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> If the new approach works, we will stop using this mechanism<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:14)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> unclaimed tickets, y’all: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/filters/new</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> k. What units is the 5982956 value in? HTCondor usually goes by MB, so this would be 6TB? Or is it 6GB (in which case the error message REALLY should have units).<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:10:40)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I was out this morning - if anyone grabbed new tickets but is feeling overwhelmed, feel free to own over to me.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:53)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @lmichael I looked that up recently and I think it’s KB.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Yes, I certainly _imagine_ it’s supposed to be KB in the hold reason, but my point is that the use of KB units in the hold reason is inconsistent with the user log (and the HTCondor default unit for memory, which is MB).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Alternatively, If the hold reason is supposed to be in MB, then there’s a bug. Either way, it’s confusing for the user.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:09)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Is someone besides Mats able to take a quick look at the revisions to this tutorial? <a href="https://github.com/OSGConnect/INPROG-tutorial-AutoDockVina/pull/1">https://github.com/OSGConnect/INPROG-tutorial-AutoDockVina/pull/1</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:17)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ <b>@here</b><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:35)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’d like to have two reviews before merging.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:48:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hi All. Our best ongoing slots are:<br/>Mondays: 11am-12pm CT (I have one-off conflicts for 9/9 and 9/16)<br/>Wednesdays: 3-4pm CT (I have one-offs for 9/4 and 9/11)<br/>My favorite is Mondays at 11am. Thoughts?<br/>

<h3>Wed Dec 2, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:20:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge didn’t get you tagged in the above<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:00)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, I will ask/check<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:33)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> @jmvera @lmichael The Glidein logs are not streaming because of scalability and condor-g limitations (does not work on all platforms) but you can stream the ones from the job, that is all in condor, depends on what you put in your submit file. GlideinWMS provides a virtual pool, its behavior may vary depending on the condor versions and the configuration of your submit host. There should be no limitation but I never tried it.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:14)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> So, a user with “stream_output” in their submit file CAN stream?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @marcom ^<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(16:20:44)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> It should. There is nothing in GlideinWMS that blocks that. Of course there is  lot more that could go wrong. You are not in a local cluster: different condor versions, limited network connectivity, but it is all in the condor realm.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:36)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks! @jmvera I’d suggest that you as the user to remove stream_output from their job, explaining that it is likely to cause significant network issues, at which time we would hold all of their jobs, losing progress. And, that we’re considering policy to completely block users from using that feature.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:04)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> already made that suggestion for those reasons<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:21)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> but didn't add the note about changing policy to address this<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:26:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> :+1: Might be good to make sure it’s not a suggestion, and to say that we’re considering policy.<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(16:28:49)</span> <b>marcom:</b></span> I think this can be easily controlled at the schedd level<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:28)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I wrote "please remove [these attributes]" and elaborated on why and indicated that other more reliable options may exist to support their needs<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> You can do the blame-it-on-the-boss thing. “After discussing with my team lead, I need to ask you to remove  …,. We are considering policy changes to prevent users from using that feature in OSG. If we see it in your future jobs, or certainly if there are network issues, we will have to put your jobs on hold, which will cause you to lose progress.”<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Okay, maybe do the follow-up to check that they’ve actually removed it (and check again in 1-2 weeks?)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:31)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We’ll discuss as a group on Monday and add it to a config change request list to communicate to the Ops team.<br/>

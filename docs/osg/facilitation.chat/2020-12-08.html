<h3>Tue Dec 8, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:56:24)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @jmvera @christinalk @emelie I have added you all to our trial SetMore instance and granted you Admin access so you should be able to poke at all the settings/features. Unfortunately calendar integration is a premium feature so we won’t be able to test that out. I think I have most of the important settings established. On the plus side, SetMore allows you to offer classes (I have to turned off for now), so we could utilize it for workshop registration too if we wanted.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, the following ticket may be a good example of follow-up facilitation, partially because this user is good at asking general questions and bringing specific issues up. <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66434">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66434</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @jmvera can you make sure that all of our documented example and tutorial submit files DO use the ‘log’ file (and avoid ‘transfer_output_files’ as much as possible, in the context of the example)? I know you’ve probably done some of this already, but there may also be work that we can split up, too (especially since changing the tutorial files may require more planning/effort, in concert with accompanying documentation).<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:30:32)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> we've removed all examples of <tt>transfer_output_files</tt>  from OSG Connectbook<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:30:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I thought so! :+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:17)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> some may remain in various <tt>tutorial</tt> examples<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:36)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> those will require a bit more effort to identify<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> let’s start a plan to tackle them.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:16)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> lately I've been using <tt>...other submit file details...</tt> in example submit files to reduce the amount of lines/text in these examples and better emphasize the specific details been shared in the guide but we can also just make it a point to *always* include <tt>log</tt>, <tt>error</tt>, and <tt>output</tt> in example submit files<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:32)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> What about making HTCondor always create a log file, by default?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:33)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I've also got a rough draft of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsTRyJrlUCAtbnjq5bDVQy2e3PpAyjSEl_oun1MTbTI/edit?usp=sharing">Connectbook Docs Style Sheet</a> started, I think several group members were absent from the meeting when I first shared with the group<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:46:46)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael I have an account request from the acting CIO of LBL. Sounds like they’re interested in exploring OSG capabilities - is an OSG Connect account a reasonable thing for that? do you want to meet w/ this person?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:51:13)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> also, I have an account request from someone at the Proton Therapy Institute at Hampton University: <a href="https://hamptonproton.hamptonu.edu/">https://hamptonproton.hamptonu.edu/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:51:33)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ this looks like it falls in our academic/research bounds, yes?<br/>

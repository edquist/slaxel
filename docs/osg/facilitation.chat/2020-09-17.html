<h3>Thu Sep 17, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @cbrown58 we confirmed that your “new ticket” scenario *does* send an email even though it doesn’t appear in the ticket, correct?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:32)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes. It has worked in my test and I’ve had users respond to it.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:47)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> But I have had a higher rate of “no responses” so i am hesitant, but these people also didn’t respond to my followup.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:58)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> So I think it’s a spam filter issue because of FD, not because of the automation.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:12)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> But I still need to reach out to the individuals outside of FD to verify<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:12)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay! I had the same feeling (a higher rate of no response) but agree that it’s probably a spam, not freshdesk thing. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> The follow-ups outside of FreshDesk should be informative, particularly if we can ask about Spam. “I am wondering if you received our email via &lt;support-address&gt;. Perhaps they went to your Spam folder? If so, feel free to reply to that thread.”<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:46)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> If we need to, we can look into ways to help reduce the Spam filtering, maybe.<br/>

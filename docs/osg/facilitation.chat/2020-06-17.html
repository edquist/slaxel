<h3>Wed Jun 17, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:43)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I'm stuck on how to proceed with the following ticket: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65172">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65172</a><br/>It's his first time trying to use OSG connect after login node transition earlier this year<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:57)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Jess, I’d guess that his umich account is *not* linked to his globus<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:51)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> he could try logging into the OSG website w/ globus instead of umich and see if that works<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:44:04)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> and/or, log into globus and link his umich identity w/ his globus one.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:44:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> If he wants to be able to use his umich to log into the OSG Connect website, should link the two identities (which has to be done via <a href="http://globus.org">globus.org</a>)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:45:02)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> if he doesn’t care about that, could try the first option.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @jmvera let us know how the above situation pans out?<br/>

<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:54)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> will do<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-07-02 10:14:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-07-02 11:08:33)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> success, see #osg-connect, Bennet was able to get us his Globus ID and Chris manually linked his account and Bennet is now able to log in<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:18)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Looks like Bennet was *unable* to login to <a href="http://osgconnect.net">osgconnect.net</a> with his globus id re:<a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65172">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65172</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:01)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> HMMMMM<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:08)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> He’s definitely there in the website…<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:44:00)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Yeah, that's why I'm a bit confused...<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’d maybe message Chris Weaver in the osg-connect channel<br/>

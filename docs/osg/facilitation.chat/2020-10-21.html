<h3>Wed Oct 21, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:15:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Weekly reminder. Please have updated notes for yet-to-resolve follow-ups (and start the ones you haven’t started yet) ASAP, resolving and noting those that ARE resolved. I’ll be reviewing first thing Monday morning, and there are 10 that don’t even have ticket numbers/first follow-up, yet, some of which are three weeks old.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:16:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> If anyone has a concern that they’ll exhaust their OSG time commitment, please contact me directly with details, so we can rebalance your work together. We currently have no excuse for falling this far behind.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:07)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> FYI Jess’s internet is down so I’ll be triaging tickets this afternoon<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:16)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Internet is back! Thanks @christinalk<br/>

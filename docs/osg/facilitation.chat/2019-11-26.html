<h3>Tue Nov 26, 2019 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:36)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> I just did an initial consultation with a faculty member who brought a buddy prof, and I’m waiting on the account request from a prof (Manny Curotto). Make sure to send my way? (I’ll be on the lookout and will try to grab it, too.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, something we didn’t quite reach a definitive conclusion on yesterday:  I don’t think we need to send a ‘staff outage’ email to OSG Connect users for T-giving, especially since we’ll have people in the office on Wednesday. We can “thank you for your patience while we were out for the Thanksgiving holiday” when replying to thur-fri tickets on Monday. Sound good?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:58)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, I think that is better than sending out an email to 2k people<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:30)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Agreed, and I’ll try to keep an eye on tickets for anything urgent.<br/>

<h3>Mon Jul 6, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:42:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> hi <b>@here</b> I’m looking at our “Compiling Applications” guide, and I think it could use some work, at least under “Compilation Server”:<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000652099-compiling-applications-for-osg-connect">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000652099-compiling-applications-for-osg-connect</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:43:38)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Can we get more specific, there? Right now, it doesn’t show a full “Requirements” statement (or the full word “Requirements”, and gives the impression that users include “Centos6” in their requirements, without explaining that code compiled on 7 will not run on 6, and without giving the user an idea of how they can determine which major version their login node is.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Can someone take this up before end-of-week? (maybe someone like Jess or Emelie, who have less OSG prep tow orry about until it’s exercise testing time)<br/>

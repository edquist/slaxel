<h3>Fri Jul 17, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge @cbrown58 @emelie @jmvera @christinalk How do we feel things are going after this first week of the OSG virtual school? Anything that’s been difficult to keep up with or that we should rebalance? Anyone *not* filling their OSG time, and could take on more?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (Carrie is out, so I’m not expecting her to respond, or at least not until much later.)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:12)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Hi Lauren.  It’s going okay so far.  Exercise testing takes a long time (for me), but then there’s some downtime after I finish a set, so I think the OSG time will probably work out about right.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:21)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It has been good on my end - no real blockers or headaches<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> good to hear. I got a check-in with Jess earlier saying the same.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:12:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Anyone feel like contacting user tlatorre (login04) and getting them to us a different queue statement, instead of many single-process submit files?<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:05)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I met w/ a group today that is using data available “by request”<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:39)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> we don’t happen to have any option for data available via stashcache but where the data is not publicly available, do we?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Not really.  There are options, but all of them would need to be designed.  We have all the tools, just not currently setup.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:29:18)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> hmmm, okay<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:41)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> While debugging an issue at FNAL, they say: <tt>One thing we did notice while we have been looking into this is that there are a few OSG jobs that are hitting up <a href="http://rsquid0001.chtc.wisc.edu">rsquid0001.chtc.wisc.edu</a> for very large files and taking a long time to do it.  One job has been going for 4 hours stuck on a curl command and has pulled in 1.5GB of data so far.  The file is growing but slowly.  Networking to other locations is fine, so the slowness appears to be at the wisc side.</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:35:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Any ideas what user that is?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:14)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> could be someone running Matlab jobs with the latest runtime<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:25)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> we normally don’t recommend using files larger than 1GB from our squid server<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:30)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> but those runtime files are pretty massive<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:45)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> do they have any username info?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:47)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Not yet<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:46)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’ll pass along to our ops team<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:45:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> back at FNAL: we have a user pulling data from stashcache and having problems for jobs that ran at fermi<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Maybe the same issue I'm seeing with the glideins<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Timeouts?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:29)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> not that I can see - the only error messages seem to be that his commands aren’t found. So maybe it’s something else<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:29:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> hmmm, I wonder if the issue is that “zip” isn’t present on FNAL servers. Who could I talk to about this?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:38)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> zip (at some point) wasn’t present in CHTC<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I don’t think it’s necessarily a RHEL-based native. But gzip is!<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:31:29)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ @rynge does such a thing exist? If not, does it make sense to make one?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:34:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> No, it is up to the sites<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:38:23)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> what if the sites are using a container?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> This is one of the use cases for containers - you get a consistent environment<br/>

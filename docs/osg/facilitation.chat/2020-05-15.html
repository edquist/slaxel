<h3>Fri May 15, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:01:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> For those who are taking new engagements and support tickets, please make sure you’re checking at least 2-3 times a day. We’re increasingly missing our intended first-response targets. (Mats’ effort is saturated with COVID19 and when we specifically need his help with tickets the rest of us have, so we’re not expecting the same from him, atm.)<br/>

<h3>Mon Oct 26, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> make sure to review all of your tickets (even closed) and emails from freshdesk for recent updates from users. Apparently the ‘re-open after requestor replies’ automation was inadvertently broken as of sometime last week. So you may ONLY have email notification (and no re-opening of tickets) when users have replied.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> you can view all your tickets (even closed/resolved) and sort by last updated, which (I think) will include put tickets updated even by the user at the top.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:27)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> have any of you heard from Dan Andresen about OSG accounts for a class he’s teaching?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:01)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ <b>@here</b><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:15)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:25)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I can handle that if you’d like. I spoke with him initially about this.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:58)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> AH, okay, no worries then<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:13)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Dave Turner mentioned it in a follow up ticket and I just wanted to make sure Dan had connected w/ one of us<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:17)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> :+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:02)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I havent spoke with him since the initial inquiry, so feel free to encourage him to reach out to me. And I can follow up later too.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:27)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, my conversation was through an intermediary, but hopefully they mention it to Dan.<br/>

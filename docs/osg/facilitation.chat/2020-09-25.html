<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:50)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Sorry for any emails anyone is getting. There was a user who applied to join a project but I was unable to approve the user or add myself as admin to the project without adding ALL admins. I am now manually removing everyone. Could we see about making this process a bit easier? Such as allowing admins to add themselves (and only themselves) as admin to a project, or being able to approve pending members without being added to the project?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:44:21)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Also, when removing people from a project, it would be nice if it returned to the Member list afterwards and not the Members Pending tab.<br/>

Chris has moved on, but we’ll need to ask from effort (and identify whom). It may take a few weeks to sort out who would do the work, so we should at least start prioritizing the changes we want.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:43:56)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I’ll start a doc and throw a link into our meeting notes for discussion.<br/>

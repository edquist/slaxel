<h3>Fri Mar 6, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:15)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I am working on revising the <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000048518">Accessing Software using Distributed Environment Modules</a> page on ConnectBook and was wondering why we have a different set of modules that become available after loading GCC 6.2.0?<br/><br/>I assume that GCC 6.2.0 is a dependency for these additional modules, but we can have GCC loaded recursively by the dependent modules instead of having a separate list, this is something we have implemented with our HTC modules currently<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:01)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @jmvera When you say different modules available, are you talking about the output of the <tt>module avail</tt> command?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:49)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> currently the page (that i linked) states that additional modules will be visible via <tt>module avail</tt> after GCC 6.2.0 has been loaded by the user<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:04)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I see. In lmod, the module avail command will only show modules that can be direct loaded. Which means if a module has a dependency, it won’t show up in <tt>module avail</tt> until that dependency is loaded. I instruct our users to use <tt>module spider</tt> as a search tool instead of relying on <tt>module avail</tt>.<br/><br/>I would like to see the <tt>module avail</tt> command removed from the docs all together (but we should get consensus on that before implementing it).<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:36)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> As far as having things loaded recursively, I am not sure that is something we can do with lmod (if we can, please let me know!). Does CHTC use lmod for their modules?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:42)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Yes, Lmod is compatible with recursive module loading for managing dependencies (as stated by Tim S., one of our infrastructure/sys admins)<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:35)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Good to know! If it is set up that way, do all of the modules show up in <tt>module avail</tt> then? Even without the recursive module loaded?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:00)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> will have to look at it further, but got an engagement to do now<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:02)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Sounds good :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @jmvera Huh, I thought we did not have gcc anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:25)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Let me check<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:58)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre>✘-1 [rynge@login04:~] $ module spider gcc<br/>Lmod has detected the following error:  Unable to find: "gcc".</pre><br/><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I want to take a pass on that page. Let me know when you are done<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:10)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> oh! I guess that is at least one part that needs to be updated<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:17)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> what's the difference between the following email addresses: <a href="mailto:support@osgconnect.net">support@osgconnect.net</a>, <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.net">support@opensciencegrid.net</a>, and <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>? What sorts of inquires should go to what email address? Currently <a href="mailto:support@osconnect.net">support@osconnect.net</a> is on the connect book website under <a href="mailto:support@osgconnect.net">Email the OSG Connect Support Team</a> but then on the <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634383-contacting-the-osg">Contacting the OSG</a> a different email is listed<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:30)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @jmvera I am pretty sure we decided that the contact email on the documentation should be <tt><a href="mailto:support@osgconnect.net">support@osgconnect.net</a></tt>  - let me check the meeting notes.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:07)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Nothing in the notes. I have a sticky note on my monitor that I wrote down the above on, but perhaps we should verify with @lmichael<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:58)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Hi facilitators.  You guys tend to be "faster" on the ticket triage.  Any tools you use to get notification for new tickets?  Am I missing useful tools?  Or are you just really good at having the tab open and looking occasionally?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:04)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Hi @dweitzel I’m the wrong person to ask because I don’t check as often as the others.  I do get email notifications when there is a new ticket though.  I just don’t always see them.  We recently implemented a system where each person is assigned a different day to keep a closer eye on tickets.  Maybe others have better tips??<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:26)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, so you get emails for every new ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:28)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Interesting...<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:38)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> That's a good tool.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:40)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Can be annoying…<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Well yes, but not a bad way to get your attention.  It would work for me.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I wonder if in operations we could filter to only get emails if a new ticket is assigned to operations group?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:11)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> I believe so because in HCC Freshdesk I only get notifications if it’s in the applications group.  But I haven’t looked at all the options recently…<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:50)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I only get automated notifications for account request tickets<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:06)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I've been using my Outlook calendar to remind me to check FD on my assigned triage day. I have a weekly recurring meeting with a reminder notification that I snooze for 1-2 hours after checking FD<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:39:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @dweitzel It’s very possible to set up email notification automations, including when a ticket is owned to a specific group. @blin knows the interface a bit better than me, and may be able to help directly. Let’s bring it up at the next AC meeting where we can discuss FreshDesk?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dweitzel you're an admin so you should be able to add the automation yourself (settings -&gt; automations -&gt; ticket updates)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> pretty straightforward from there<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:47)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Neat, ok.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:25)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> How does facilitation handle the triage?  Is the idea of a rotating person on triage built into freshdesk?  My preference is that only the person on triage gets these emails.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:11)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We haven’t gotten that far, IF it’s even possible.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:44)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We only recently switched to the triage route, which we solidify (for the next 1-2 weeks) at each week’s team huddle on Mondays.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I, personally, like getting emails for all new tickets, partially because I can jump in and grab one that I want, or I can choose to ignore the notifications.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> but it’s probably different for the users WE help (and how we want to help them), versus those that Ops helps.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:10:07)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Since we are talking about freshdesk.  I am seeing "reopening" emails when I set the email state to "Waiting on customer"  If the customer responds, it's not really "reopening", it's expected behavior.<br/>

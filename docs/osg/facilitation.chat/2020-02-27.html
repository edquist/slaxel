<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b>, so the form email reply after user/project activation seems to have been changed at some point, but is still really wrong? <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/campus-research/accounts-and-projects/accounts/">https://opensciencegrid.org/campus-research/accounts-and-projects/accounts/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @emelie were you still going to update it? What template are we using in the meantime?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael I thought that email was what you’d been using?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Can you paste what you use now and we can update both the website + the canned response?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:39)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> I submitted a pull request to update the response for non-institutional email used in application.  But I did not change the email you are referring to.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah. Where are we pulling from for those responses, now? Are we each rolling our own? (I just did.)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I use the canned responses in freshdesk<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:03)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> although I made my own custom version, so I should go back and make sure it’s up to date.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:56)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I tend to use the canned responses. I didn’t notice an error though. What is wrong with it as it is now?<br/>

I am currently planning to ask if they can access the submit node at Georgia Tech, but is there any other consideration I should keep in mind?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:36)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Are they supposed to be working through the LIGO VO?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> (Is there a LIGO VO?)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Although I’m not sure how they would know that. :grimacing:<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:18)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Do we lock/close dormant projects?  Natasha would like ‘BioAlgorithms’ reinstated.  I’m not sure how to do that.<br/>

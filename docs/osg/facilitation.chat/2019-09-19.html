<h3>Thu Sep 19, 2019 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:21)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Do we have any special handling for JLab projects?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Versus what (current situation)? Special in what way?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:14)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I just didn’t know if they were handled by a specific individual. I just wanted to verify that there wasn’t anything unique I needed to do before creating the project.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:52:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> talk to @efajardo<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (he’s not part of this channel, and probably doesn’t need to be, but …) he knows the JLab context and was talking about how they actually want separate projects rather than one ‘JLab’ project<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I imagine you’ll be fine to create the new project as you would with any other, and that the users will add +ProjectName, even though they’re not in Globus (the users) and there’s no validation that they’re using the correct ProjectName at submit time<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Is this someone with an OSG Connect (Globus) account? (who is asking for the project)<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:06)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> This individual has a Duke Connect account, and wants to stay associated with both the Duke and this new JLab project.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:57:11)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I’ll send the ticket link.<br/>

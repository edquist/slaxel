<h3>Fri Nov 22, 2019 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(06:11:04)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Apparently quite a few people decided to request accounts yesterday evening. They don’t look related (in a way that would be suspect), but make sure we get the right email addresses and Globus accounts.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(06:13:04)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, looks like kid has strep on top of croup (as I also have strep), but I’m technically on preplanned vacation, anyway. Please keep an eye on my tix again? Shouldn’t be much traffic at all.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(07:41:12)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have a meeting w/ an Arizona research group<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(07:41:25)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> (today) so it’s probably for that if they’re AZ addresses<br/>

<h3>Tue Dec 1, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:32)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Are we ok with someone using <tt>stream_output = true</tt> in their submit file?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:25)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Generally, not. (Ultimately, it may not cause problems if for relatively few jobs and/or very small amounts of data.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> But, with the scale of jobs and amounts of data typical to OSG users, it will almost always overburden the submit server bandwidth (and potentially, HTCondor processes, though Iâ€™m not sure).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Did someone ask?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:15:06)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> that's what I figured. An old follow up reopened the ticket and I looked at his submit file and it includes the following which I wanted to address:<br/><pre>+OpenScienceGrid=True<br/>stream_output=True<br/>stream_error=True</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:14:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> IIRC, it might be disabled in the glideins<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:53:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Can you double-check that, Mats? (Or loop in someone who can?)<br/>

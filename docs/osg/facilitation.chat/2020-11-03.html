<h3>Tue Nov 3, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:55:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge @cbrown58 I would suggest a single project for all of them, and that we have Dan instruct all of them to request accounts during a class session (making sure they use their institutional identity), using some recognizable keyword in the comment of their request (so that we can easily separate them from other account requests coming in that day).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:55:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We could even build an automation rule in FreshDesk that looks for the keyword in the incoming body of the ticket and owns to the ‘right’ person. We should also ask Dan to send us a list of names.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:57:36)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> We're going to have to do it asynchronously I think. I dont think the class does live sessions.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:58:07)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> The first two presentations (video for the second) from the OSG VSP might be appropriate: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMAvxsFJaw4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMAvxsFJaw4</a><br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:00)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I was going to write up a hand out linking to a video like this and our quickstart tutorials.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:07)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thumbs up!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> W still need to ‘fix’ our quickstart tutorial, though …<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (still send it, but we need to discuss)<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:59:30)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Ok<br/>

<h3>Wed Jan 6, 2021 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:16:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> wondering which of our facilitators would be interested/available to join a very small class (1 instructor + 2 students) to do a brief initial facilitation and present some basics of HTCondor job submission *on Jan 20th at 2pm*. (I think @christinalk @jmvera @cbrown58 have recent experience with something similar, and could take their pick of existing presentations from HTCondor Week/OSG School for job submission basics.)<br/><a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66542">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66542</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:22:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ^ Also an FYI for whomever has triage the rest of the week (see brief ticket history for the names and flags of two incoming account requests)<br/>

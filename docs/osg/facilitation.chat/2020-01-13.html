<h3>Mon Jan 13, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:26)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> This is my proposal for a tutorial at PEARC 2020, mentioned on the #osg-connect support call today: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifarQKoOCs6AMY8NaY7CQtI5ZXOGHCjWTdUA85XS5nE/edit#heading=h.hcghb1of9r8n">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ifarQKoOCs6AMY8NaY7CQtI5ZXOGHCjWTdUA85XS5nE/edit#heading=h.hcghb1of9r8n</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:01)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I have a proposal for the CLAS12 project modifications that may be useful.  I propose adding a CPU hours (as opposed to core hours) graph to the page: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/osg-connect-summary-2">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/osg-connect-summary-2</a><br/>A few definitions:<br/>Core Hours = WallTime * # proccessors allocated<br/>CPU Hours = Time spent on the cpu<br/>Cpu hours can be decreased if the job is waiting on IO, running on GPUs (and therefore not using the CPU), or many other things.  But it can be useful if you know the workflow to spot inefficiencies.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:11:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> And I would like to add a Text box next to the graph with with most of what I wrote above.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:47)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I would suggest changing the name:<br/>Seems like you are counting whole CPU chips vs single cores, while you obviously are not!<br/>How about “Used Core Hours”?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Or "Core utilization" as a %<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:11:02)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Probably can't do a core utilization, limitation of the technology.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @isfiligoi I'm not sure I understand your statement.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:42)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> like we talk about “GPUs” as “GPU chips”, one could easily think of “CPUs” as “CPU chips”<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:55)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> especially when the alternative is “cores”<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:34)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> just trying to avoid confusion<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:16:56)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, ok.  So the difference between CPUs, Cores (and sockets).<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:19:09)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Ah, without getting into too much of the semantics, looking for feedback for the proposal.  I'm hoping that this could be generally useful, while not being too confusing.  More good than bad.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:41:58)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m worried this is more confusing (bad) than helpful. CPU efficiency is generally much less helpful in bulk (graphing like the user is asking) than on a per-job basis. Can we go back and ask the user WHY they want such a graph? Why they would want to look at “CPU efficiency” in bulk, across jobs?<br/>

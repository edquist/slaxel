<h3>Mon Jul 13, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:00:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <b>@here</b> If you have any tickets you need me to watch this week, please reassign them to me<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:59:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> will do!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:37)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> so apparently our pearc tutorial is already full. :joy:<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:16)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes, for a bit now. I was informed on Friday :)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Wow<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:25)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’m surprised! also, I can’t remember what I set the limit as? so I don’t know how many people that is?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> How many people is that?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:03)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> With the required workshop registrations this year, I wonder what our show up rate will be.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:27:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It has been higher in the meetings I have been at - people have time as they are not traveling :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It also makes me wonder if we are getting the "right" attendees<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I mean people interested in contributing to OSG, or people just generally interested in OSG<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:39:46)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I don’t think we want either of those groups; we’re most interested in people contributing their researchers to OSG. ;)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:49:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Any chance you can check in with the organizers to see what our cap is, and if we can increase it?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:56)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @christinalk Right - that is what I was trying to say...<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:02)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Yes, I emailed Gwen to ask and will follow up tomorow if I don’t hear<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:03:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge you should go ahead with the COVID-19 projects. Try to see if you can figure out how urgent/important these projects are. Are they relevant to real-time clinical treatment/trials (highest priority, in my book), hoping to inform therapeutics/treatment but not directly collaborating with clinical work, or working more on the basic science of COVID-19 (long-term knowledge/understanding; lowest priority)?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ok, will do<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The good news is that the project is already set up<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:48)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> These are just additional users on it<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(21:01:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> nice!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(21:01:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> a project you’ve already helped with?<br/>

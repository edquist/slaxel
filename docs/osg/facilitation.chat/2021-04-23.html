<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:04)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Does anyone have information on any CryoEM analyses that been done on OSG? I am looking into what other groups have done in this front.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:45)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ @lmichael any idea?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Not that I know of, but there ARE steps in some CryoEM analysis pipelines that would be good candidates, based upon discussion with our new CryoEM center at UW-Madison. Some of the common analysis software assumes it’s running on a single server for all workflow steps, but we totally had a researcher at UW-Madison run work on CHTC that could have been on OSG, but was really only several hundreds 1-hour job each time he ran - easy enough for our local resources to chew through in an afternoon, anyway.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:26)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Good to know. Thanks for the info!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Basically, there are steps that have to look at all images in a set, together, and steps that look at each image (e.g. frame, tomogram, etc.) independently. It’s those independent steps that can be really time consuming to run in serial or even just on a single server, and splitting can make a big difference. Especially when there are multiple movies (sets of frames or tomograms) to analyze, HTC-style parallelization makes big difference.<br/>
<span style="color: #bb86b7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:47:32)</span> <b>dart:</b></span> This seems like a case where a template workflow might be really valuable (if there is enough commonality among use cases for it)<br/>

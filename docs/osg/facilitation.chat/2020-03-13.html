<h3>Fri Mar 13, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:04)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Regarding the user in Italy who previously had access to OSG (<a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64568">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64568</a>). They sent in screen shots of previous tickets (I feel like I should have caught those) and it appears they had an account to utilize Fsurf. Iâ€™m not clear if I should grant access here or if the non-US affiliation clause holds. @lmichael can you provide any direction here?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We have discontinued fsurf, which WAS available to anyone in the world, not subject to our US affiliation requirement (one of many flaws). For regular access to OSG Connect, we cannot compromise the requirement for US affiliation to someone who used fsurf.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:40:34)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Sounds good. Thank you!<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Facilitators, I need you help with identifying potential speakers for this year’s AHM, which I’ve begun listing in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nJ_J0-gRQzgtRfgDq_3YFKtWcCLycjjbMBhklQ901vo/edit#gid=0">sheet</a>.<br/>Please do the following by EOB tomorrow:<br/>1. Add any projects you think should be listed, ESPECIALLY if you know of a project with a user from a past OSG SS (at top, in consideration for the David Swanson award).<br/>2. Add your name at right if you know you’ve been in touch with someone from the listed project in the last year; maybe link to a ticket.  (There may be more than one of you for each project.)<br/>3. Fill in/add to any fields for projects that you know something for, especially: usernames, Notable Features, etc.<br/>(The projects in bold are those that I’ll start contacting soon, but please don’t email/invite anyone, YET.)<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-01-08 12:02:48)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> PING on this input from @jmvera @christinalk @emelie @cbrown58 @rynge. I’m going to be the one that coordinates these speakers for the AHM (giving them tips on content, etc.), but YOUR input on which projects/users have good stories and ability to tell them is invaluable. I may also ask you to send a VERY brief email to some you have a relationship with, but mostly to hand them to me.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(2021-01-08 15:47:05)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Thank you, Christina! I see that you added stuff.<br/><br/>Others, please!<br/>

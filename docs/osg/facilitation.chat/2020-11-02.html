<h3>Mon Nov 2, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:58)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> For FD, do we need a "reopen" email of the state goes from "Waiting on Customer" -&gt; "Open"?  Since that is expected behavior, the user responded, do we need an additional email and a "reopened" tag on the ticket?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:58)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Re our discussion today about training: from ticket 65874: <tt>One of our professors will be having his 70 students in his HPC class get on OSG shortly so we may have more questions then.</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ^^ yep, this is what I was talking about<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:30)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That's the same guy?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:35)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> yes<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> same thread - I did a follow up w/ Dave a week or two ago<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:41:41)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ah interesting! So he know what to do with those students?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:46)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I don’t know! Dave isn’t teaching the class, Dan Andresen is, and I don’t know what he’s planning.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:46:55)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @cbrown58 may know more.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:47:31)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I pinged Dan today about this but haven't heard back yet<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:47:45)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Actually, he just messaged heh. I'll update shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:48:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Good - I will then close the ticket I have with Dave Turner<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:28)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> He wants to go ahead and proceed with the class. Hes asking about the possibility of a recorded session in place of the live presentation.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:55:44)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I told them I would inquire, but that if it wasn't possible we could prepare a handout that he could distribute to his students.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(17:02:38)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @christinalk do you know if there are any existing recordings of previous presentations that might be applicable? Some of the User School material maybe?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:59)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I'm not sure<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:09:31)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I was just wondering about if this was going to be a unique projectname and if all students would have full accounts<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(17:13:20)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes, that was the plan that was discussed. If you have a better method though, we can go that route.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:43:52)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I don't have anything better<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:43:57)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That is what I did for PEARC<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:44:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But it will be a lot of clicking accepting and assigning those 70 students<br/>

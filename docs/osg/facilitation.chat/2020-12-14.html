<h3>Mon Dec 14, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:43:48)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Anyone know if Rob Quick is still around?  This is an “old” user who’s affiliation is tied to Rob.  <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66469">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66469</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:31)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I responded in a note!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:56:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (Rob is not around, so treat this like anyone hoping to re-gain access after deactivation due to inactivity. They’ll still need a corroborated affiliation and PI/sponsor, which may not be Rob, anymore. If the person claims it *IS* Rob, please let me know.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cbrown58 can you get to the following ASAP? <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66468">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66468</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I just replied. If there’s anything else that Santiago needs from you (a template email?) please follow up?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:52)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Would someone else be able to do the new user facilitation meeting with Qingzhao Yu at 2:30 tomorrow?  I could create the project.  <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66472">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66472</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I cannot (otherwise I would!)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:36)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> It’s alright, I got it.<br/>

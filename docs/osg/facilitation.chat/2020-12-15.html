<h3>Tue Dec 15, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hi <b>@here</b>. About a month ago, you may remember that I asked some of you about progress in certain aspects of our work, which was for our first monthly report to our NSF program officer. We’re putting things together a little differently this time, such that I think I can more directly solicit your help/input now and for future reports.<br/><br/>*Please look through and add items by EOB tomorrow* reflecting our work in the last month:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/138NVJLxjr17I-tFYEO-PaXQjRYBJ-zMTYruGAbp_ikc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/138NVJLxjr17I-tFYEO-PaXQjRYBJ-zMTYruGAbp_ikc/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>For example, Jess can reasonably tackle documentation additions, etc. Carrie can add in details (even more than I’ve staged) for supporting the KSU course. Now that we’re getting handle on the process, I’ll end up creating one of these earlier so that we can dump ideas as they come to us, and just do some refinement at the end of the month.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:59:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Let me know what questions or thoughts you have, especially if WHERE to put something you’ve worked on in the last month.<br/>

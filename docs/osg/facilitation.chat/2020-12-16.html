<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:48)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Anyone know this user: gziegler ?   Nothing bad, just using StashCache a ton!  And, according to monitoring, using it perfectly! (reading the same data over and over)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:22)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> I helped onboard him a couple weeks ago I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:55)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Awesome, so even a new user.  Well then, kudos!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @emelie what can you tell us about their affiliation, research interests, and computational need for StashCache (feel free to take time to ask them, if you need to). Might be a good impact story!<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:13)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Well, all I know is what I put in the onboarding notes.  I looks like we did discuss stashcache.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:16)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> “Greg Ziegler is a researcher at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. He researches plant phenotyping which involves measuring different traits in plants. His focus is on the concentration of elements in corn and soybean kernels. He uses computing to do genome-wide association studies: comparing/correlating differences in genome sequences of different plant varieties to measured traits of the plants. He uses both R and C/C++ for these analyses which he currently runs on the Danforth center cluster (consisting of ~a few hundred CPUS). <br/>His jobs fit well into the OSG job requirments: 4-8 hours long, up to 3-4GB memory, independent single-core jobs. He is familiar with HTCondor and uses it currently. His jobs all use the same ~2GB input file(s). (I directed him to using stashcache or /public for input files).”<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:02)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> perfect, he seems to be using it for his public input files<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:40:28)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ah, it’s the plant center guy!<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:41:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Great facilitation. I’m going to mark him down for a future story. Would be good to keep an eye on his usage pattern, too.<br/>

<h3>Thu Sep 3, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:59)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael I’m going to remove WayneStateU_Pique-Regi from my list of follow-ups — he *just* had his account re-enabled on a login node in Aug (missed the great migration in Jan) so he doesn’t fall into the category of “lots of usage, now less” — there is no previous “lots of usage.”<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:24:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> (unless that category means something different? let me know!)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> ah, I think I’ve misunderstood the goal. I thought we were contacting people whose usage has dropped off, but it looks like the opposite? Like, “we see you’re back, is there anything we can do to help?”<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk please keep him in and do follow up. We’re not really looking for ‘little usage after a lot’, but ‘little usage in a month’ that looks like there may have been challenges we could help with (whether new usage, or new after some time). If you just re-enabled this person’s account, and they only had a blip, they probably tried something that failed.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:05:58)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Ah, okay, I see<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We’ll talk more tomorrow, too, but first priority is to get all your fields filled in for the stuff you’ve followed up with already.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:11)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think it’s more likely that they’re very busy and haven’t really had a chance to dig in, but I’m happy to follow up<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks!<br/>

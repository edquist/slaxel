<h3>Wed Jun 24, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:23)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> has anyone <b>@here</b> worked w/ virtual flow before?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:51)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have a user with it and they seem to have a lot of scripting built around running “workflows” that will need to be dismantled - any experience would be helpful before I start digging through scripts.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> nope? Can you help the _user_ dig through the scripts? (or together?)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> yes, that’s my plan once I’ve done an initial triage.<br/>

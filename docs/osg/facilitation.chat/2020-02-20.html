<h3>Thu Feb 20, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @here, Iâ€™ve been at the ER with my husband this morning and will likely be indisposed the rest of the day. Can someone check in on my open/waiting tickets? There are a number that are for setting up meetings, which can be ignored until I get to them, but please look out for user issues.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I looked at them this morning<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:36:38)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> and took one and replied to any that needed responses<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:17)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Hope you get good care + everyone feels better! :hospital:<br/>

<h3>Fri May 8, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:03:39)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Question, what should I do if a user applies under one institution but has another’s email? User applied listing Harvard as their institution but has a <tt><a href="http://umich.edu">umich.edu</a></tt> email address.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:21)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Follow up question. Our canned response for non-institutional email addresses says to let us know if their institute isn’t listed. We have an application from the Boston Children’s Hospital which is not listed. What do we do in this situation? Should I have them create a Globus ID with their institutional email address?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:47)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I think we’ve had people from Boston Children’s before… @lmichael??<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:10)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I had someone with conflicting emails recently and I think I did a normal response but asked them which is their primary home<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (1) Follow up, explain the inconsistency, and have them make sure to sign up with the current/right email address.<br/><br/>(2) What email address/affiliation did you see come through for Boston Children’s?  (BTW, still reply to them within 4 business hours to ask for clarification of their situation - many BCH people have Harvard affiliations, too, etc., and let them know you’ll try to figure out what they should do.)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:08)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, we have two Boston Children's projects registered:<br/>• <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/BCH_Holt.yaml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/BCH_Holt.yaml</a><br/>• <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/BCH_ResearchComputing.yaml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology/blob/master/projects/BCH_ResearchComputing.yaml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:16:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Otherwise, their first request could come in under Gmail or Globus, and then we just need the proper email address in the OSG Connect interface.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin yup. They typically have Harvard affiliations (or BU, etc.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:17:36)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I did not realize that BCH is not in InCommon (yet)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:51)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ahhh ok<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(17:50:18)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @lmichael It came in as gmail. In that situation, would I just have the user edit the email then?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(17:58:48)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I sent out the initial meeting request for now and will handle the email bit during the process.<br/>

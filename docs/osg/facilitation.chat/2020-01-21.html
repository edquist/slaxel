<h3>Tue Jan 21, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:06)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hey <b>@channel</b>, just checking in since we didn’t have a meeting this week (Happy MLKJ Day!)<br/><br/>What overarching issues are we working on, what are people focusing on this week, and what coordination do we need with others (even outside #facilitation)?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:38)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ll start: I’m making sure we close the loop with CC* submissions (due today!), PEARC20 submissions (due tomorrow! @christinalk already did our user/facilitator training, but RobG has an admin training, and FrankW/Igor are submitting an extended workshop on dHTC, which I’ve helped shape), preparing for OSG AHM (fellows committee/candidate wrangling, CC* campus invites, other science speaker invites, our user/facilitator training), assisting with decisions/processes relevant to the OSG login node/web transition (if any), and taking tickets where I can.<br/>

<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:36:49)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @lmichael - Mostly just handling tickets as they appear.  Most of the grant proposals I have been involved with are now wrapped up, so please let me know if there are any current projects that I can pour some effort into!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I am keeping up with tickets also, especially transition related stuff. I want to circle back to our documentation categorization and edits when I have time.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:42:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I think @jmvera is working hard at testing (to learn, for herself), reviewing/proofreading, and even correcting/re-writing documentation relevant to upstart.<br/>

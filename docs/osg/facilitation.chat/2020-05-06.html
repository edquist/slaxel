<h3>Wed May 6, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:00:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @emelie I was thinking/hoping he was a researcher and that your investigations would shed light on what we should do. If he’s not a researcher between positions (e.g. grad student, post-doc, faculty), and no one at Georgia Tech (or other applicable institution) will vouge for him, then we probably shouldn’t offer him access until then because we don’t have the assurance we need that his use of OSG Connect is for acad/np/govt purposes. (Also, FYI, Georgia Tech has been sharing resources with OSG for years, and has already added their new cluster to that.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:00:50)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Sound good? If you’d like, I’m happy to step into the ticket to break the news to him.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:10)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> @lmichael Yes, I would like you to take over the ticket.  I did not get that at all from your notes on your ticket that said: “he should continue to have access for a year, so even without affiliation, you could set a reminder on this ticket to remind you end of July to remove his access”.  Also “If not correct affiliation, then we just need a reminder to remove his access at end of July. If correct affiliation, then no need.”  Apparently, I am not able to properly interpret these notes, so please take over if you don’t mind.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> done. Thanks, and sorry for the confusion. This is the first such case, and upon further consideration and input from leadership, the lack of affiliation would be less of a concern or at least more easily mitigated (if between appointments, but could still get a faculty PI to ‘sponsor’) versus a previous academic staff member that has not such position now. We can discuss more on Monday, too, as a group. This was a difficult situation, and you handled it as best as you could, given the input you got.<br/>

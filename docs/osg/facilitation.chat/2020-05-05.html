<h3>Tue May 5, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:30:59)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, please expect several account requests to come through from UPenn that can be merged and met with together: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64907">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64907</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:03)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Jose Alfredo Gonzalez-Espinoza, <a href="mailto:jage@sas.upenn.edu">jage@sas.upenn.edu</a><br/>Taylor Kessinger, <a href="mailto:tkess@sas.upenn.edu">tkess@sas.upenn.edu</a><br/>Colin Twomey, <a href="mailto:crtwomey@sas.upenn.edu">crtwomey@sas.upenn.edu</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:34:19)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Singularity issue hasn’t been grabbed, and I’m not sure I can take it (lacking expertise and time): <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64898">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/64898</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, please remember to look at All New Tickets (not just OSG Connect) as some come in without a Group assignment, and part of what we do is help assign those to areas, since we have more staff and tix to regularly look at new tix.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:04)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I grabbed the singularity ticket.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @rynge just owned you a ticket asking for  PR merge on the singularity repo<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cat, @emelie is trying to get an OSG School student going again on OSG Connect, but it turns out that he doesn’t have a current affiliation or PI. Should we still enable, and what are your thoughts on ProjectName (where we would normally prefer “Institution_PILastName”.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:56:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @emelie may be able to add context about the lack of affiliation<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:07)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> He used to be a sys admin at Montana State and he anticipates a future affiliation with Georgia Tech (where they will be looking into contributing computing resources to OSG), but he didn’t offer more than that.  I originally sent him the “what is your affiliation please” email, but Lauren suggested we give him a 1 year temporary account anyway since he had a previous affiliation and was involved in the OSG User School.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:22)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> don't forget to add me in a note if you are taking new user engagements! :grin:<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:44)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Hi, everybody!<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:00)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Who is the former School participant?<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:10)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Erik Bryer<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:22)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Yeah, that was my guess.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:19)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I don’t feel compelled to violate our rules in this case — i.e., no affiliation or collaboration, no account.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:47)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> That will be awkward.  I already told him he could have one because Lauren approved it.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:49)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> That could be framed along the lines of encouraging contact with us as soon as such affiliation or collaboration exists.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:09)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ah, well, not sure why you bothered me then.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:14)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> @cat has left the channel<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:31)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> OMG, really?<br/>

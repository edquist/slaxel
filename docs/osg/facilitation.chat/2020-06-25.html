<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have someone who wants to use rosetta<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:05:51)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I vaguely recall that this is something users have to download + install themselves b/c you have to register to download it?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:04)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> is that true? does anyone have any current knowledge/tips for running rosetta?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:12:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yes, you need to register and download it. However, I have recently heard of instances where Rosetta was convinced to say yes to cluster-wide/module-based installation. But, we canâ€™t put it into a public container.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:06)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @christinalk COVID19_Stanford_Das is running Rosetta<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:12)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> They ship a tarball with each job<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But the submit file is simple<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:21:50)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Rosetta tarballs can be big, but they can also be cut down (which Greg did for COVID19_RepertoireTCell)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:17)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, so process is to download a copy of rosetta + then just ship the tarball w/ each job?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:22:38)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yes<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:23:53)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> This one has two special-sauces:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Precomputed seeds and a increase memory requests in case of multiple failures<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:36)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> does rosetta need the AVX?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:24:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Turns out the code exploded on some seeds and we wanted to be able to retry over and over again<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> This one did, but I guess that depends on where you compile it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:25:24)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> This user also runs a custom version<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:27:14)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I bet for a regular Rosetta users, you can get away with standard memory request, no precomputed seeds and maybe factoring out the avx requirement<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(17:04:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk you may want to bug Greg Thain. I bet he went more generic (no AVX, etc.).<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:05)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> will do<br/>

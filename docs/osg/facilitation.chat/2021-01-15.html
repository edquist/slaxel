<h3>Fri Jan 15, 2021 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:04:38)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> random question: should I create a new project for Tim Slauson (at CHTC, so something like CHTC-staff) or should I just lump him in with Flightworthy and/or OSG-Staff?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:13)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> hmmm. I’m leaning toward CHTC, and then making that inclusive of anyone in CHTC (including RCFs on OSG-Staff and Flightworthy members). You ready to do the clerical work? This is, btw, why a user can be part of more than one project (you probably should be on Flightworthy, too).<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:23:41)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay! I’ll make a CHTC-staff project and then add all the Flightworthy people as well.<br/>

<h3>Tue Aug 27, 2019 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Is anyone already planning to attend the Area Coordinators call tomorrow at 2pm CT? Perhaps @rynge (see Tim’s regular announcement email)<br/>I’ll be traveling back to Madison, and I am scheduled to land just before, but I imagine I’ll be late, at best, so it would be good to have a surrogate (for Research Facilitation). If @rynge isn’t already going to attend, then I’d prefer to leave his time to other things.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:11:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I can attend<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:47)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I try to make those meetings, if necessary, I can make a point to attend tomorrow as well.<br/>

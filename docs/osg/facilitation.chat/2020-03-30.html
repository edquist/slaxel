<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:27)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Feeling a bit off this morning - no covid symptoms fwiw, but I think I’m going to lay down and rest. I will miss today’s meeting, but will check Slack and email so don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:47:57)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I already answered. :joy: I said that we could do it online, which I think is true - I had already set it up to be a back and forth between presentation, discussion, and hands-on which I think will work well online.<br/>

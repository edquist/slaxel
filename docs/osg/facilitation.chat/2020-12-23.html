<h3>Wed Dec 23, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:49:50)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael is it possible to use the encrypted directory feature on the OSG?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> almost certainly not. Research that needs it is also not a good fit for OSG, for other reasons (shared login nodes, etc.). Can you elaborate?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:32)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> it’s a feature that has to be explicitly turned on (and the right enryption software installed) on the execute side<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:55)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> See my comments above - a ticket came in yesterday with someone wondering about the feasibility of running VASP on the OSG<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:25)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ah. I’ve got another user testing VASP. Can they point us to the license requirements?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:59)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> see ticket: <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66512">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66512</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:01:26)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ve constructed a response. This is a very good use case to bring up with HTCSS (Todd) and Production (Brian), in case we can better support such users in the future. It’s not that their working with sensitive data, but maybe we can learn to support software with these types of requirements (like the cloud does).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:10:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Generally, VASP is okay on a shared cluster with multiple admins who do not sign agreements (like in CHTC), so VASP devs may decide that VASP is okay on OSG.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> that was my sense as well. Thanks for writing a response - that will be a useful reference for the future!<br/>

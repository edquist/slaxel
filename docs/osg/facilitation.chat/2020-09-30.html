<h3>Wed Sep 30, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @emelie I’ve got some ‘easy’ ticket work for you, if you want it<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:09)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Sure @lmichael I can take a look.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> It’s some simple follow-up work. Primarily, finding users who are significantly under- or over-requesting memory (based upon job metrics for <a href="http://flock.opensciencegrid.org/overview/login04.php">login04</a> and <a href="http://flock.opensciencegrid.org/overview/login05.php">login05</a> and condor_history) and contacting them to help them optimize their requests, based upon their past user log and condor_history data, and knowing that they can consult those tools when running future tests for new sets of jobs.<br/>Same for users transferring too much data with HTCondor file transfer (again, flagged in the job metrics).<br/>If you start with people who are over-requesting (or not requesting at all), you’re likely to get significant/easy uptake, because the user has a lot to gain in throughput.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:04:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ve put some really easy ones in the Follow-Up sheet, already, and I’m happy to share my quick checks with condor_history, since the login node metrics (linked above) only show average, and not distributions (since some users have sets of jobs that use varying amounts of memory and disk, and the request needs to accommodate the higher values).<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> You’ve also got a lingering Follow-Up from August (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZKOlfqjy4puZiuNMvLTeOBdROOmPuVSklrtnHyOlac/edit#gid=0">sheet</a>) that looks like the user might still REALLY benefit from some additional TLC, based upon their GRACC data.<br/>Regarding the follow-ups on resource requests and file transfer, I’m happy to meet to work together and document the quick check via job metrics and condor_history).<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(17:15:27)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> is this a facilitation ticket? <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65776">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65776</a> Rob is OSG staff yes?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:37:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @jmvera I'll take that one<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(19:44:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks, Mats!<br/>

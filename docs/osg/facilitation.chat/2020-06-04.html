<h3>Thu Jun 4, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:16)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I have a user who currently has 300 jobs running at once, has sent an email saying it’s usually more about 100.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I would expect them to have more usage.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:03)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @rynge have we made any changes in how the OSG pool is prioritized?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:57)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> No, Frank asked me to work with sites to see if they could balance things on their end. I can do that, but need to now what the workload is like. Any special requirements?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:18)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> this person’s jobs look like pretty standard 1 CPU / 1Gb of memory<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:31)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> user is <tt>snirgaz</tt> on login04<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Great! I will send email to some sites and see what happens<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:40)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:57)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We should look at his workload also<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Higher than average number of job restarts<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:26)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <a href="http://flock.opensciencegrid.org/overview/login04.php">http://flock.opensciencegrid.org/overview/login04.php</a><br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Could be that he needs to up that requested memory a little bit<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I can communicate that to him.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:00)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> looks like 1221 (should be the memory request)<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:59)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @christinalk Sent email to some large sites<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:06)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thanks<br/>

<h3>Tue Sep 15, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:34:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I will now accept laughs for the fact that the CompChem user (with low new hours) was ME.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:35:56)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> this makes me chuckle, but only because I can see it happening to me as well. :joy:<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:21:50)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I'm tempted to send you a follow up email, see if there's anything we can help you with :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:56)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> but at least it explains the weirdness I was observing regarding the CompChem usage...<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:29)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> is there an upper bound for home dir quotas on OSG Connect?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:00:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yes-ish. What isthe user asking for?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:01:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (and the practical limit is something that will increase with some PATh-fundable infrastructure upgrades, but not TODAY)<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:08:34)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> Based on the input/output and number of jobs, they will need about 1TB of space for two user each<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> per-job amounts? input vs output?<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(15:31:35)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/f00f2ccad3c44ac5ad3ed4c413d2a7274e7e639e1e948dcdc5faa236d9cf401d">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/public/tickets/f00f2ccad3c44ac5ad3ed4c413d2a7274e7e639e1e948dcdc5faa236d9cf401d</a><br/>they plan to submit 3-4 batches at a time of ~6.6K jobs per batch with 20MB input per batch and average ~50MB per job<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> how long are the jobs? can/should they be combined. I donâ€™t see their answer about job durations, and combining *might* given an opportunity for output consolidation (which would help their end-goal, as well, since they have to transfer off and post-process, presumably)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <tt>/home</tt> has ~7 TB available (login04 or login05), so I think we can give them each 1 TB, as long as it comes with a date at which we will follow up to plan on decreasing. Make sure you get that from them, then make the request to lincoln/judith in #osg-connect<br/>

<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:37)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Do account requests from Fermilab get routed to anyone in particular?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:27)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @christinalk @rynge Any idea? ^<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:44)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> …that’s a good question.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:58)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I would wonder why they need an account w/ us - Fermi has a lot of local resources.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:52)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> i don't see anything about Fermi in the "flowchart" <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x-ttoFxE7VlMUKyEKa_u454yd_UIdFgiLfdJj0zcBkM/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x-ttoFxE7VlMUKyEKa_u454yd_UIdFgiLfdJj0zcBkM/edit#gid=0</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:49:31)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> This is probably a good example for “Did you intend to request access to a Fermilab-managed submission point into OSG? We’re happy to support you on OSG Connect, so just let us know, but you may want to check first with your the Fermilab research computing team. You may find that Fermilab has some specialized support for Fermilab members through their submission point, like integration with local data storage and Fermilab user accounts.”<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:49:52)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> If we want to document the above in the flowchart and/or in email templates, go for it!<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:33)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I added FNAL to the LIGO version of the email to the templates and added a line on the flowchart (its pretty sparse, so if anyone knows of more info that should be included, feel free to add it!)<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:36:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> I’m out today and at least tomorrow taking care of a sick kid again. It looks like I won’t be able to join our 11am call without lots of upset toddler sounds. Please make sure outages are discussed and covered. Internal and user documentation are next priorities after catchup on transition-related matters.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:12)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk can you help me figure out who user ‘sindridelamancha’ is, using project Rowan_Nguyen? I can’t find them in the app, and it looks like you’ve worked with one of the two projects from Rowan with PI last name Nguyen (there’s also Rowan_NguyenT). Interested because of low new weekly hours for follow-up. <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65176">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/65176</a><br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:21:50)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> User is Nicholas Kaegi<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:18)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’m guessing the PI is trying to get his students going over the holidays - we had a new account request for that group on Wednesday<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:30)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I can still follow up, but I imagine that’s what’s happening<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:11)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ve added it to the follow-up sheet assigned to you (I took another), so please handle accordingly!<br/>

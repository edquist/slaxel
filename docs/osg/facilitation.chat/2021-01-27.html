<h3>Wed Jan 27, 2021 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:08:48)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> do we have resources for OSG Connect users interested in Snakemake?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> No, we tried to have somebody contribute documentation at some point but I think that didn't happen<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:05)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> but it's possible to implement on an osg connect access point?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:35)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think it is just running on the submit host and submit directly to HTCondor<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But it is a long time ago I looked at it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:09:02)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> At least that is what it did for Slurm at that point<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(12:36:17)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> hmm, well I'm not sure how to reply to <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66649">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/a/tickets/66649</a>, anyone have suggestions???<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> If he has a snakemake pipeline in mind, we could try porting it for him and maybe get a guide out of that work?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:38:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Quick googling shows several htcondor modules for snakemake<br/>

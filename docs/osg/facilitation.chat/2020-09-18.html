<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:27)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> If someone wants to use OSG for a class, do we have the students sign up for official accounts, or do we provide temporary training ones?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:13)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @rynge @christinalk @lmichael see above :)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:03)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’d like to do what we did for PEARC20. Bonus with a course is that we can have students request accounts ahead of time (during a prior class period) and check them against a list from the prof. We also h e the opportunity to speak to the class, if the prof thinks that would help.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Christina and Jess have relevant experience from our campus HTC system.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:00)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> agree - I think having them apply (and note they’re in the class) with a “real account” works best. Then the point person grabs the tickets, checks w/ list, approves + adds to class project.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:32)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Also! I met w/ someone today (Daniel Jacobs) who will be applying for an account - if it comes in, please send to me. :grin:<br/>

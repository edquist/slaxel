<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Regarding PEARC'20 tutorial attendee account requests: please add them to the <tt>Tutorial-PEARC20</tt> project and <tt>login05</tt> submit host<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:45)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Can we tag these tickets too with <tt>PEARC20</tt> in FreshDesk?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> How do we tag?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Nevermind, found it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:21)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Done - I have tagged the first user account request<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:46)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Thanks Mats!<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:41:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @lmichael Another user move:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:41:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <pre>I have been using OSG resources during my PhD, which is over. I have just started my postdoc career at Fermilab Quantum Institute and would like to continue using OSG resources and spread the joy of science all over the world. Should I update my account since my status has changed? Will I be able to continue accessing OSG resources?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>-- <br/>A. Barış Özgüler, PhD</pre><br/><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:06)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge Baris was at UW-Madison before. Fermilab Quantum Institute is part of Fermilab, so it qualifies. Is there a different question?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:35)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Are you worried that he should be using a Fermilab submit point?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> No that part is clean - but we need to understand he can switch institutional auth from UW to FNAL, and still use the same Connect account<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ask @cnweaver. My user (potential guinea pig for account transition) ended up not needing the transition. We’ll definitely want a new project (that’s the easy part), but I’m not sure about the rest, and didn’t get the opportunity to explore, myself. Let’s talk about what you find out at the next RF team meeting (Aug 3, if you’ll add to the agenda)?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:25:54)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Have anyone been invited to Brella? Seems like a lot of speakers are already one, but I haven't seen anything for the tutorial<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(13:26:53)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I was invited as part of my registration, I think.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:47)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Hmm<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:40)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> It says I should have received an email<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Looking now<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:36)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yeah, people registered before last Friday got a Brella invitation last Friday. People registered after that got it same-day as they registered.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> also, you just reminded me that I need to nudge about @jmvera and @emelie’s special non-paid registration. Or did you ladies get anything from PEARC20 yet?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:00)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Looks like I did not get it - I have asked for a link<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:33)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Ah, I did<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:39)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Sigh<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:57)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I haven't seen anything from Pearc organizers<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:07)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> follow-up sent to the organizers<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:33)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> worst-case, I can harass them during Friday’s PEARC20 planning meeting …<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Well even logged in, Brella does not know I'm presenting<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:29)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So I guess Christina will hand out privileges during the meeting?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:58)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I logged in as well without being linked to my presentations. I’m not sure how that is supposed to work. Has anyone seen a presenter-specific interface?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:47)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Ahh looks like the hand off might occur manually right before each session.<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:34:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think one missing part is a slide describing how we will use Zoom during the event (breakout rooms? how would a attendee indicate to us that they need help? ...)<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:48:43)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> <b>@here</b>, any more specific instructions for me on what exercises I should be reviewing for Monday?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:49)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> here’s the list:<br/>Right now I have the following tutorials as potential exercises, which would need testing: <br/><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__support.opensciencegrid.org_support_solutions_articles_5000634379-2Drunning-2Da-2Dmolecule-2Ddocking-2Djob-2Dwith-2Dautodock-2Dvina&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=gRgGjJ3BkIsb5y6s49QqsA&amp;r=ElIsLUs_HX98UDztKnaC35CYcNJeLQTmvcRCQFcapGjlZsNXuc9nj8QuxloIb3OY&amp;m=SCGQEM4mR5F6xbxEX9nbK0_qT_UELbPn-giQmBkRnU4&amp;s=jMJWNo-NdaUughA6L9_ci-MN-NS3enzPlgEUSY7Vfng&amp;e=">AutoDock</a><br/><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__support.opensciencegrid.org_support_solutions_articles_12000062019-2D-2Dlarge-2Dscale-2Dcomputation-2Dwith-2Dhtcondor-2Ds-2Dqueue-2Dcommand-2D&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=gRgGjJ3BkIsb5y6s49QqsA&amp;r=ElIsLUs_HX98UDztKnaC35CYcNJeLQTmvcRCQFcapGjlZsNXuc9nj8QuxloIb3OY&amp;m=SCGQEM4mR5F6xbxEX9nbK0_qT_UELbPn-giQmBkRnU4&amp;s=wpTfBn_TEcXy-1BisZyoGMiOHxHNZ2MN8OB6_YkPXsk&amp;e=">Python</a><br/><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__support.opensciencegrid.org_support_solutions_articles_12000062020-2Drunning-2Da-2Dblast-2Dworkflow&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=gRgGjJ3BkIsb5y6s49QqsA&amp;r=ElIsLUs_HX98UDztKnaC35CYcNJeLQTmvcRCQFcapGjlZsNXuc9nj8QuxloIb3OY&amp;m=SCGQEM4mR5F6xbxEX9nbK0_qT_UELbPn-giQmBkRnU4&amp;s=mEP11TmQa166vCeN3UKS3oVqMNkQvlVM9SXi7d95w14&amp;e=">Blast</a><br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:26)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> Okay, thanks Christina.  That’s what I had from the email you sent.  I just wanted to make sure that was still accurate.<br/>
<span style="color: #3c989f"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:40)</span> <b>emelie:</b></span> So far AutoDock is mostly fine.  I’m part way through python and there are some pretty major differences between the tutorial files and the instructions document.  Also, it requests RHEL 6 and I’m assuming uses a rhel 6 python module.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:38)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, maybe skip that for now. :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>

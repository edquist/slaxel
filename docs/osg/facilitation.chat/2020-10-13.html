<h3>Tue Oct 13, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Just wanted to say that it looks like our ticket handling is going really well since implementing our triage processes.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cbrown58 do you think that we could implement the ‘reopen-after-X-days’ features without needing to use a ticket type? (thinking about scenarios, which I know you’ve used for the first reply to new user accounts) If so, we would not need to change a ticket type from ‘new account request’ just to do re-opening.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-10-14 12:43:54)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’ve added you back as admin.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(2020-10-14 14:18:48)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Yes, we can have it depend on a number of fields (but not Tags). I propose we implement a new Status (ie. “Closed”, “Open”, etc) called “Snoozed” (or something similarly descriptive) . The automation would then auto open these tickets after a certain length of time.<br/>

<h3>Wed Oct 14, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:24)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, there are some assigned follow-ups that seem to be getting a bit long in the tooth (or need an update, if they’ve already been pursued). Make sure to update the Follow-up sheet by end of week, and please indicated dates in your Facilitation/Resolution Notes: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZKOlfqjy4puZiuNMvLTeOBdROOmPuVSklrtnHyOlac/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZKOlfqjy4puZiuNMvLTeOBdROOmPuVSklrtnHyOlac/edit#gid=0</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:22)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @rynge are you able to follow up with the singularity error I reported on Monday?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:11)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Missed the thread - following up now<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:37)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(11:38:19)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @cbrown58 there may be a UW Madison user Abhishek applying for an OSG Connect account today - feel free to assign to me if/when it comes in<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:09)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> @jmvera See above :slightly_smiling_face: (Jess and I swapped days for tickets)<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:43)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> :+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:51:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk I made a comment on your addition to the UserFacing Priorities doc. The other items are a bit more self-explanatory, I think. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWMCUFvKcn60kwlj_qpQzF0gmG1LC1pNo_z-4jH7xTk/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UWMCUFvKcn60kwlj_qpQzF0gmG1LC1pNo_z-4jH7xTk/edit</a><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(12:43:49)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <b>@here</b> if any tickets come in related to a cornell galaxy server / the Cornell Lai group, feel free to give to me<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:44:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @jmvera is on duty<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:30)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I sent an email to a user identified for follow up facilitation because of low usage and if they didn’t respond and haven’t had any usage since, should I send another email and if so, what should it contain?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:57)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> okay, I’m working on a follow up email for someone — one of the issues I could address is having small files in /public instead of /home. Do we care about this?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:55)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael I also did more digging on one of the “submitting out of /public” people and he doesn’t actually need a follow up. Should I just delete that row in the spreadsheet or add notes indicating why I didn’t email?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:40:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Like, the person doesn’t actually have files in /public? (Can you elaborate on why they don’t need a follow-up?)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:14)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> It doesn’t look like he actually submitted jobs out of /public<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:57)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> there are sample submit files, but they haven’t been run — I can conclude with near 100% certainty that they’re in that folder for sharing purposes (like, “download this sample file”)<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:23)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> also, the owner of that folder hasn’t run any significant number of jobs; their colleague under the same project *has* and is doing everything correctly.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(17:14:28)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> can they host the example submit files on GitHub instead though?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(19:04:28)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I could ask.<br/>

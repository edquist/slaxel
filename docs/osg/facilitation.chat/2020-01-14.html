<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:05:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> For this particular project (CLAS12):<br/>&gt; ... but the CPU hours is no more there, which was very useful for us as it monitors symptoms of possible problems with opportunistic vs non-opportunistic resources.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:09:51)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> @isfiligoi has left the channel<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:48)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @dweitzel Where did they see CPU hours before? Are they sure that was what they thought it was?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:58)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I looked through the history, and I don't think it ever existed on that page.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:08)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Maybe they were confused on the pages.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:19)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> though, I'm not sure what other page has that information.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:25)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Yeah, so you could tell them that you don’t think we ever had CPU hours before (offer up the alternatives that we HAVE had), but can they point to an example that they currently see in GRACC, but not on the OSG Connect page. It sounds like there’s a miscommunication/misunderstanding of what they want.<br/>

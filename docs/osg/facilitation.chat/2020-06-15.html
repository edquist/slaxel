<h3>Mon Jun 15, 2020 : #facilitation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:05)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> What meeting room are we using today?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:53)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> NM, it’s in the agenda :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:44:49)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Might be late. SLATE training is running long.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:48)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> <b>@here</b> greg thain tells me there’s an incoming account request from a group doing COVID-19 work. @lmichael should we do a normal (albeit expedited) onboaring?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:31:32)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (just double-checking: it’s not from the UW-Madison space?)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:01)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> yes, normal but expedited. Ideally, I’ll join/lead. Let me know when it comes in?<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:44:07)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> :+1:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:22:33)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Please ensure to prepend the project name with <tt>COVID19_</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:23:47)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> @lmichael it just came in and I owned to you.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:35:24)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @christinalk thanks. Greg told me it’s for an existing project (student working with Amir Bitran of COVID19_Harvard_Bitran). So, it should really just be a show-the-ropes scenario to get the account activated ASAP, and then Greg will continue to work with both Amir and the student (Brian). So, do you or someone else (with a more open schedule than myself for tomorrow/Wed) want to take it?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:48:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Brian (Zijun Zhao) is available anytime Wednesday for :point_up:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:13)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I’m taking Wed morning off, but maybe @jmvera could take?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:09)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> or @emelie or @cbrown58. Who has a chunk of time (maybe 30min) to get this researcher on-boarded? He’ll really just need an intro to OSG, the basic notion that data is moved to/from resources, and not a full on-boarding. (project already exists, will have ongoing help from Greg Thain and myself, already had the initial consultation on achieving better throughput and job scaling.) My own schedule on Wednesday is full, as I’ll be out in the afternoon for an appointment.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:39)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> (would be a good scenario for @jmvera if she wants it)<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(16:05:46)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> I could do Thursday or Friday, but the first half of this week is pretty busy for me.<br/>
<span style="color: #4d5e26"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:39)</span> <b>jmvera:</b></span> I am available Wed morning and can take the ticket<br/>

<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:34)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I keep see them trickling in<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:10)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> It’s been interesting to see how applicants deviate from the instructions the later their application occurs heh<br/>

<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:50:31)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> A cool feature request would be to have a "join code" field in the new user form, and be able to automatically accept accounts and add to a special group based on that code<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:13:27)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> Completely agree! In fact, I've already put that into my debriefing notes :grin:<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Please make sure your follow-ups have entries for all of columns A-K (don’t forget K - Resolution Notes - to identify your observation that the users problem had been resolved or they told you they had abandoned)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:45)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> See my column K for Mines_Leach (cnatzke) for example.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:06:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @cbrown58 how many students are in your list for the KSU class? (It’s a LOT, and we should probably divvy up the work next time.)<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(17:03:48)</span> <b>cbrown58:</b></span> There are 61 students + Dan’s account. We’ve authorized 49 of these so far.<br/>

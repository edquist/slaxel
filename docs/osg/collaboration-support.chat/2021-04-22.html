<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:57)</span> <b>mehmet.belgin:</b></span> Thank you everyone for troubleshooting this issue! Just so I have a good understanding: How certain are we that the issue is with bosco, and similarly, that the new release will resolve it? On a related question, @blin, I know it'll be difficult to know for sure,  but do you have a rough estimation for when the new version will be out (days, weeks or months?). IceCube is the main user of GPUs at the moment, in addition to OSG, and the local submission capabilities will get us going for a while, but I'm expecting many external IceCube users soon as GPU resources available to that VO are known to be scarce.<br/>

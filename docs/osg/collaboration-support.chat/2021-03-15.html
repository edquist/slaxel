<h3>Mon Mar 15, 2021 : #collaboration-support (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(17:03:24)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> @marian we’ll need some additional help tto figure out why jobs are. not flocking out of the osg-login2.pace submit host. Let us know of your availability.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:06:19)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> for the flocking, I guess @rynge is expert here ... what I can advise at best would be compare configs elsewhere? did it work as expected from osg-login1 previously?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:03)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> tomorrow I could be available around 11am, though ... before that I have series of meetings<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:07:14)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> would that work if you ping me then?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:08:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> (unless we get any opinion from @rynge in the meantime)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(17:12:52)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i have reached to mats. I will update here. The rreason for tagging you is hatt the main iissue is with the ligo jobs not matchining on the grid and going only to the local pool<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:09:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @ruben.lara We have configure the OSG Open Pool to accept jobs from your <a href="http://osg-login2.pace.gatech.edu">osg-login2.pace.gatech.edu</a> host. Pascal and I tested it. For this to work, all jobs have to have an accounting project specified (<tt>+ProjectName = "..."</tt> in the submit file). The projects should be specific to research group and in the form {institution}_{PI}, but in your case we can do something like <tt>GATech_PACE</tt> for testing. If you agree that is a good name, I can register it for you.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(18:21:20)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> Let’s do <tt>GATech_OSG_PACE</tt> for the project name.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(18:21:50)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> @ruben.lara @mehmet.belgin?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(20:59:49)</span> <b>ruben.lara:</b></span> Yes, please register <tt>GATech_PACE</tt>. That will allow us to test occasionally.<br/>

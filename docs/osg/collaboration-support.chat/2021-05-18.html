<h3>Tue May 18, 2021 : #collaboration-support (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:16)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @paschos - for JLab, I see the following requirement in the CLAS12 jobs:<br/><pre>OSG_GLIDEIN_VERSION &gt;= 546</pre><br/>and the following in a freshly-started glidein:<br/><pre>OSG_GLIDEIN_VERSION = 534</pre><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:21:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jdost321 @marian ^^^ that appears to be either a schedd or a frontend config issue.  Either way, the factory and the site are off the hook.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:22:44)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> ok.. will update the ticket and talk to maurizio about it<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:23:14)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> will move the ticket back to collab support<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:42:45)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ehm, not sure where in the FE as I'm admin and didn't touch it, but somebody from JLAB could have done something on the schedd side ...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:17)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah.  I suspect they updated the schedd setting (maybe to get a bugfix for flocking to OSG?) and forgot do the same update on the frontend.<br/><br/>@rynge - any chance you worked with them on their flocking to the OS Pool?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:18:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I might have helped long time ago - can't remember<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> honestly, I'm not finding anything disturbing in the FE config at least: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/blob/master/manifests/production/vo-frontend-gluex/frontend.xml">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/blob/master/manifests/production/vo-frontend-gluex/frontend.xml</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:10:59)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> anybody?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:35:35)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @marian - this is the JLab frontend, not the GlueX frontend.  I believe JLab operates it.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:37:57)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ah, that's Richard Jones then?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> no, moment, I have intermix here<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:38:51)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> GLUEX was always plan put under JLAB ... JLAB has "sub VO" CLAS12 and EIC<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(16:39:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> CLAS12, I don't see in Tiger... bummer, is it still in Nautilus at UCSD?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:01:13)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, disregard, I just checked with Diego if there is something like this in the osg namespace at UCSD's k8s ...<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:23:11)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> after more investigation all points to a still development instance of JLab FE which acts as production one for JLab FE, btw: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/tree/JLabFrontend">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/tiger-osg-config/tree/JLabFrontend</a> ... some remnant to deal with after Edgar's leave ... my best guess, but I wonder how this could have slipped ... probably because of no obvious issues so far<br/>

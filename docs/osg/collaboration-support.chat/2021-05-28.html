<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:29)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> Yeah probably. @jdost321 is running into a similar issue and he's coordinating with the Condor team<br/>

<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:46:35)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> jeff thinks he knows where the bug is but it may require patching bosco the previous way even with the new release<br/>

<h3>Tue Jun 1, 2021 : #collaboration-support (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(17:00:19)</span> <b>trever.nightingale:</b></span> I have updated the osg-login2 cert for pace.  This cert expires June 3rd.  The new cert was generated from the same key, so no key change.  I am attempting to validate that condor (I guess?) has sucked it up or is using it.  I.e. trying to figure that out.<br/>

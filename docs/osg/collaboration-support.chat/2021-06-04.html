<h3>Fri Jun 4, 2021 : #collaboration-support (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(09:39:36)</span> <b>trever.nightingale:</b></span> I found condor stopped this morning, so it appears cert renewal requires that it be restarted.  I'm not sure what we need to do (if anything) on the storage (osg-gftp2).<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:16:54)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @ruben.lara, unless you removed old line already, I'd keep them that they are in sync with condor_mapfile on the UCSD collector ... We have a plan migrate collector to the Tiger/Kubernetes OSG infrastructure within following month, starting with USCD collector next week and will be doing first clean up there. Another thing, since changes of format of incommon certs bite us from time to time there is another reason to keep old, too.<br/>

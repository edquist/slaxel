<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(17:55:59)</span> <b>trever.nightingale:</b></span> We have the following certs that will expire, but we don't want to renew nor<br/>install certs that aren't in use because we suspect some were just generated<br/>before install/configuration with the expectation they would be needed, when in<br/>fact they are not needed. This page explains nothing to assist with such an understanding:<br/><a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/security/host-certs/overview/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/security/host-certs/overview/</a>:<br/><br/>So, which of these certs is needed and why?<br/>osg-gftp2<br/>osg-login2<br/>osg-sched2 (k8 container on slate server I think)<br/><br/>WHAT do they do? What are they used for? Eg., why does our ssh head node ("login server", aka osg-login2) need a certificate?<br/>Why would our osg-sched2 need a certificate? (For talking to the factory?)<br/>

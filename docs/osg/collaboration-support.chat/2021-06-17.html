<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'd be very curious why is that what evidence you have for it ... it should/must support non-escaped format ... if it doesn't then I can think there is something wrong typed in in the line<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:00)</span> <b>ruben.lara:</b></span> Not a lot, really. Iâ€™ve seen messages tagged with <tt>SECURITY</tt> in the <tt>/var/log/condor/SchedLog</tt> file, only for the entries that start with <tt>^</tt>. Nothing more. If you see the jobs flowing properly, then disregard my last comment, please.<br/>

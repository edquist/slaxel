<span style="color: #4ec0d6"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:41)</span> <b>peter.couvares:</b></span> James doesn't appear to be able to get any non-PRP opportunistic GPUs on OSG for RIFT, and I'm curious why. Is it because there are none to get? Is it because none of them allow VO=LIGO? Is it because no one mounts the necessary CVMFS repository (and thus HAS_CVMFS_LIGO_CONTAINERS in his requirements can't be satisfied)?<br/><br/>To be clear: this isn't so much a complaint as an attempt to understand.<br/>

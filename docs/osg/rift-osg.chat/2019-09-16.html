<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:14:55)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> @james.clark How would you describe RIFT jobs in a sentence, and why are GPUs a good match?<br/>Writing a slide for PRP<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:50)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @isfiligoi, just running something by richard now<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:56)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> np<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:25)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> <pre><br/>RIFT is an algorithm for parameter estimation for gravitational wave sources,<br/>using an iterative likelihood-fitting scheme with MCMC sampling to rapidly<br/>evaluate posterior probability distributions in a high-dimensional (15-D)<br/>parameter space.<br/></pre><br/>For the GPU aspect:  the likelihood evaluation is easily vectorizable and based only on simple primitives.  Plus, it's naturally compressed so it's possible to fit it on a GPU, regardless of the signal duration<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:42:45)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> Why is it important for LIGO science?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:43:58)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> The audience will know nothing of physics (to the first approximation)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:48:21)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Rapid parameter estimation is important to understand the nature of the source and the potential for multi-messenger emission.  In other words, is it worth spending telescope time following up a detection?  in an ideal world, we want to catch things like binary neutron star, or neutron star-black hole mergers "in the act" and observe all of the electromagnetic emission from the time of merger, through to the afterglow.  There's a lot to learn in the first few minutes immediately following a merger.  On the other hand, there isn't very much to look at with a telescope when you have a binary black hole merger - so knowing things like the component masses (from which you have some idea of whether it possibly features a neutron star), and knowing it *quickly* is extremely important.  People will happily interrupt observing schedules to point a telescope at a binary neutron star merger -- they'll be a lot less pleased if it turns out to be 2 black holes<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:10)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> so, the faster, the better.  Moving to GPUs speeds up that parameter estimation (and what you think the source is) by a factor of about x20<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:50:14)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> So RIFT jobs have a quasi real-time requirement?<br/>Or are you estimating parameters for use at a later time when you do have real-time needs?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:25)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> in principle, the former: as close to real time as possible.  but one thing to clarify: RIFT is not *currently* feeding into the source classification LIGO provides to astronomers.  but it can, and eventually will.  There are a couple of other reasons it's important, too:<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:20)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> a major selling point is that it provides the infrastructure to analyse data directly using the output of numerical relativity simulations, rather than relying on approximate analytic models<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:25)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I need to know why it was useful in the past few months :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>Then we can discuss how to make it more real time for proper use :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:35)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> the last few  months, it's been playing a role in analysing data using computationally expensive waveform models.  The time saved in sampling the likelihood can be spent on models which include a greater range of phenomenology: things like higher modes and precession which, when you include them, yields more accurate parameter estimation.  Evaluating those models with conventional sampling algorithms is so computationally expensive that only a limited scale of study can be carried out<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:05)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> (sorry, these reasons were probably in reverse order to what you actually needed)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:44)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> incidentally, i'm fairly certain it's the evaluation of those expensive models which is giving the rather poor utilisation statistics<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:54)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> good enough… not trying to be exhaustive… just wanting to make sure I do not say anything patently wrong<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(15:58:56)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> Will send out the slides later today, once they are in semi-reasonable shape…<br/>my presentation is tomorrow after lunch<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:59:31)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> yep, i was going to say please feel free to send them over, happy to take a look<br/>

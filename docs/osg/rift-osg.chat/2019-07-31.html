<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(20:41:07)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @isfiligoi, i was digging around some failures the RIFT folks are seeing.  They seem to be running into a lot of failures where packages expected in the docker container are missing.   The failing jobs are all landing on <tt>slot1@osg-wn-gpu-sing-ligo-795dfbc46d-tw8hf</tt>.  How can we exclude that node from the "old" way of running RIFT jobs at PRP?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:48:49)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> let me stop it<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:49:43)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I did not see any jobs starting there, so I thought it was safe to leave it running<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:49:54)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I guess it was just failing them very fast :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:49:56)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> sorry about that<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(20:50:20)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> no problem - and yep, judging by the number of failures, it must've been!<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(20:52:37)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> btw, we've also seen some deprecation warnings about the way some functions have been compiled.  I expect that's something on our end but it did make me wonder if there's a connection with the high CPU / low GPU usage..  I should know more tomorrow<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(20:52:55)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> ok, thx<br/>

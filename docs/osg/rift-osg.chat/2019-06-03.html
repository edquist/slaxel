<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:02)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> @isfiligoi told me  that the current RIFT jobs running on PRP although thy request GPU =1<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:09)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> they are mostly using CPU and very little GPU<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:43)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> Has anything changed?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:29:45)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hm, not to my knowledge. i'll confirm, though, i wonder if some test for cupy is broken<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:58:39)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> ok, turns out the latest batch of RIFT jobs that were submitted are intrinsically more CPU-intensive (a more expensive waveform approximant SEOBNRv4 fwiw).  The waveform generation - CPU-bound - in this case is more expensive than the likelihood calculations - the GPU part.  They're aware and agree that it would make more sense to run this type of job on CPUs.<br/>

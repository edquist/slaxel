<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:04)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> @james.clark @peter.couvares The PRP folks are wondering why are you not using more GPUs<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:13:59)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> do you mean the jobs are still CPU dominated?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:21)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> or is there a lack of jobs?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:14:52)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> lack of jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:20:48)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> When i spoke to them yesterday, they reported that after a few days of jobs idling mysteriously, jobs had started running ok (i was previously unaware of the idling jobs) so I was expecting things to ramp up.  They did mention that they wanted to understand a bit better what happened with the CPU-dominated jobs so there is some digging happening, i think<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:52)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> apart from the past few days of quiet time, in general there has always been only short peaks of activity (at best)â€¦<br/>The question is: Will we see a substantially higher demand in the near future?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:28:26)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> I'm somewhat surprised - i was expecting them to keep you busier, actually.  Let me confirm and double check again if there are other problems<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:38:40)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> I'm trying to find out what's going on, that's pretty underwhelming<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:16)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @isfiligoi thanks. I'm trying to follow up on where things are.  There is only ever a single job using a GPU's memory at any given time, right?  it's not shared between jobs in any way?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:39)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I do not allow sharing<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(09:26:10)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> unless you do it as part of the job itselfâ€¦ I cannot control that<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(09:27:18)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> ok, good, there is some <tt>CUBLAS_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED</tt> problem which seemed to be initially diagnosed as a memory problem but i don't think this is correct as there are exceptions.  I'm going to reproduce the problems for myself now<br/>

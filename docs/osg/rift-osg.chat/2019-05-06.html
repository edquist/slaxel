<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:23:43)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, looks like things are up and running ok.  how many slots can we expect to get?  Jake's submitted 886 jobs, 852 of which are idle.  As far as i can see, the idle jobs all report, <tt> Job has not yet been considered by the matchmaker</tt>  - this dag was submitted around 0830 PST yesterday.  Is this expected?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:50:36)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> I see oyu are using 50 gpus<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:15)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I think the most you can ever hope to get is ~150 GPUs<br/>But things are very dynamic, so as long as you get more than 40 I think the system is working as expected<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:46)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hm, i just noticed those jobs are now held.  Most likely exceeding requested memory<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:22)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> actually, the image size is zero for the held jobs.  my guess is a missing file transfer (strange, given jobs have been running to completion). i have a meting, will update shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:49)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> ok, looks like they're being bitten by the same thing i had a few months ago where there's a failure to find the x509 proxy because they're reading it directly from <tt>/tmp</tt> and that gets destroyed regularly.  @efajardo, is there even any reason to *use* an x509 for RIFT, since it's transferring data itself anyway?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:45)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> nop no real reason<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:59)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> great<br/>

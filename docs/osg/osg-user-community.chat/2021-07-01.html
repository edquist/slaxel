<h3>Thu Jul 1, 2021 : #osg-user-community (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:04)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> The UK's Research Software Engineering (RSE) society is hosting a month long <a href="https://septembrse.society-rse.org/">unconference</a> this September. There are workshops, panels, talks and more! I myself am submitting a panel proposal on how to better support underserved academic populations who wish to use scalable computing resources.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:19:25)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> My draft title &amp; abstract:<br/>• What cluster users get priority?<br/>• While enormous amounts of money have been poured into research computing at scale in the last decade, access and training on those resources continues to be sequestered mostly among well resourced university groups. How can the research computing community provide more equitable support for all individuals and groups? Do we need to reallocate resources (time, money, &amp; clock cycles) to prioritize those from underserved communities at our own institutions and collectively across the country?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:22)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> _And_ those with HTC-able workloads tend to get lesser-than treatment (since HPC Clusters are optimized for big MPI jobs and have HTC scaling weaknesses that incentivize internal parallelism for independently-parallelizable tasks, further decreasing user throughput and making it seem like users with such applications are (still) the minority). :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> _And_ those from underserved communities are more likely to have HTC-able workloads, only re-inforcing their underservedness.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:44:40)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> Am thinking of a few other communities as well<br/>• H(B|L)CU vs PWI<br/>• Community colleges<br/>• Public universities with primarily teaching faculty<br/>• Academic departments that lack major outside funding support or university favour<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(16:49:32)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> If any of the _CHTC/Path/OSG_ facilitators would interested in being a panellist, please let me know.<br/>

<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:11:58)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> <a href="https://septembrse.society-rse.org/calls/">Deadline</a> for proposal submissions is tomorrow. Sorry! :pleading_face: Since the sessions are scattered sparsely throughout each day, there might be times that would work for folks to present from Wisconsin or elsewhere in the US.<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:50)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> No worries, I was more interested that it’s happening at all.<br/>

<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(14:17:45)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> The society is trying something new because once again its not sensible to have a traditional, in-person week long conference. Will be an interesting adventure.<br/>

<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:30)</span> <b>cnatzke:</b></span> Hi all,<br/>I am giving a talk on applying dHTC to my research with OSG next week. Are there any slides that you would like included? Alternatively do you have any slides you wouldn’t mind me using to explain OSG and dHTC?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:52:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Hi Connor, I would recommend looking through out slides from the 2020 OSG Virtual School Pilot, which includes slides and verbal context (video) of their presentation:<br/><a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/#materials/">https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/#materials/</a><br/>Just use with attribution!<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:08:22)</span> <b>cnatzke:</b></span> Thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #684b6c"><span style="font-size: small">(18:08:46)</span> <b>cnatzke:</b></span> Do you have a preferred citation for the materials?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(19:50:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Reference it like any other website. In MLA that would be:<br/>“Materials.” _OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020_, Open Science Grid, July 2020, <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/#materials/">https://opensciencegrid.org/virtual-school-pilot-2020/#materials/</a>.<br/>

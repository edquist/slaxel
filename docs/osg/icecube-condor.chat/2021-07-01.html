<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:48)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dschultz we got some site reports that their GPUs aren't being used. Do you guys have OSG job pressure right now?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:32:40)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> looks like we've got lots of high-memory multi-cpu jobs in the queue, and not much else right now<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:33:27)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> so yeah, probably lack of pressure<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:35:03)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> that might be a bug though, since it looks like some of these jobs don't actually need multiple cpus<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dschultz oh interesting. let me know if it turns out to be a bug!<br/>

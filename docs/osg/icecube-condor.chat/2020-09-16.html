<span style="color: #827327"><span style="font-size: small">(12:34:23)</span> <b>jamie.rajewski:</b></span> I was talking to @dschultz about how to manage scratch space in Condor on kubernetes, and it sounds like I can set the volume to be <tt>emptyDir</tt> : <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir</a> and set a quota on ephemeral storage to make sure it doesnt grow too large. The concern though is that since a pod wont be generated on each new job (since a worker pod will just perpetually exist on a node) the directory wont be emptied on job completion; however, David pointed out that jobs should clean up after themselves, so this should be fine in itself. Is this the best way to handle scratch in a kubernetes condor environment?<br/>

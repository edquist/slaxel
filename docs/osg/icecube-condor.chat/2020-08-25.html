<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:30)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> @matyas @tim.theisen IceCube has some questions about how to use the HTCondor docker containers to set up a pool for local testing<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:40)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> @jamie.rajewski is working on this right now, and can ask specifics<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:29)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Sure<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Note that I'm not going to be very responsive this afternoon<br/>
<span style="color: #827327"><span style="font-size: small">(10:51:31)</span> <b>jamie.rajewski:</b></span> No worries, I'll drop a few and you can get back to them whenever you can. We're in no rush at the moment :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #827327"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:45)</span> <b>jamie.rajewski:</b></span> So I'm trying to get it set up as David said, and we were looking into the python condor API to interact with it. The idea was to use the API from my host to interact with the docker cluster, and we wanted to know what the "correct" way to do this would be? I believe I could use host networking when launching the containers (with the <tt>--network host</tt> option) but we also noticed that one can connect to a remote address, and we were wondering if that is a better approach to simulate the real thing? If so, what would I use as the address to connect to the docker cluster from my host?<br/>
<span style="color: #827327"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:22)</span> <b>jamie.rajewski:</b></span> If any of my knowledge is incorrect, please correct it as I am very new to trying to set up my own condor instance haha<br/>

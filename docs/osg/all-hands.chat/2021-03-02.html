<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:18)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> Hi everyone! the room is open, we’re looking forward to seeing everyone.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:32)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> There were several talks from yesterday that never got posted, plus several in today's indico that are not posted yet.. is it going to stay that way?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(11:03:47)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Sometimes it is nice to have them to go back a few slides if you have to miss part of a presentation<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:42)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Slides posted in the current time slot for Lauren's talk are the same ones she showed yesterday and not the ones she is showing now<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:37)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ah, thanks!<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(11:07:49)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> We’ll take a look, but I guess after her talk.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:02:30)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> My slides from today are posted now. (Correcting a duplicate upload of my Monday presentation.)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:23:45)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> @timm We've got but 1 presentation slides posted from Monday:  <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/47040/timetable/#20210301.detailed">https://indico.fnal.gov/event/47040/timetable/#20210301.detailed</a><br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(13:24:02)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> @timm For today we also have all but one:  <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/47040/timetable/#20210302.detailed">https://indico.fnal.gov/event/47040/timetable/#20210302.detailed</a><br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:55)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> ok thank you<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:12)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> related to the discourse discussion, might be worth just trying to get an OSG locale on <a href="https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/">https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:48)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> but my experience with bootstrapping these sorts of things is that it's not like the field of dreams...you can build it, but without lots of evangelism they will _not_ come :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(15:06:16)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> I think Mike’s suggestion is good and agree with the need for evangelism.  At least the staff will need to subscribe to be notified when people post there.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:07:28)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> We were planning to revisit our use of Slack anyway, so this will be a good opportunity to think more broadly about community interaction!<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:24)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hi <b>@here</b>, i managed to close the chat window before getting the link for the discussion room.  can someone post it, please<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:16)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> I think so, thank you<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:11:51)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Please do not post the Zoom links here!<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:06)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Thanks, Carl.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:13)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> No worries, but best to remove.<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:22)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> oh good point, apologies<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:12:36)</span> <b>stanfiem:</b></span> grumbles at those security people making things difficult....<br/>

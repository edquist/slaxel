<h3>Wed Mar 3, 2021 : #all-hands (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(06:44:40)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> While Discourse isn't the only modern *forum* platform these days, it is the one I regularly see being used by OSS projects. Any sort of platform is far preferable to email lists, particularly for its search functions and conversational threading style. <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">https://www.discourse.org/</a><br/>

<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(06:45:19)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> In addition for the financially minded, Open Source projects get a discount: <a href="https://free.discourse.group/">https://free.discourse.group/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:10:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Someone also pointed out <a href="http://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org">ask.cyberinfrastructure.org</a> as an example in the ecosystem.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:22:25)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> I will admit that it's weird to be recommending a forum-like platform 20 years after their heyday. But yeah, that looks like a really nice example of how we might want to organize things.<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(08:23:22)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> And no reason we couldn't ask some of their admins how they set it up and what things to avoid.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:42:16)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Indeed.  I suppose my biggest worry is ending up with a Discourse instance with tumbleweeds in it...<br/>
<span style="color: #9f69e7"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:55)</span> <b>mtwest2718:</b></span> A very valid concern. How many messages does support get per month? If there isn't enough traffic just for the OSG, maybe a broader dHTC topic level might be more productive.<br/>

<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:17)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Good morning, everyone!<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:57)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> <a href="http://www">http://www</a>.*gridpp*.<a href="http://ac.uk/vac/">ac.uk/vac/</a>. that's the url for Vacuum glideins<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:57)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Thanks, @timm!<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:08)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> @bbockelm for http transfers of large single files, have you thought of using partial or multipart uploads?  s3 has this feature, and I believe all the major cloud providers have added it<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:16:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @dschultz - we do _exactly_ that.  The xrootd implementation partitions the transfer across multiple streams.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:23)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> But I'm a bit suspicious of advertising that too widely.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:18:44)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> That's controlled by the <tt>X-Number-of-Stream</tt><br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:41)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Is there going to be a post-meeting Survey?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:55:37)</span> <b>jstathas:</b></span> @timm Yes, we will be sending out a survey Friday afternoon.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:00)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Since tech director monopolized half of the discussion time:  this is the question I would have asked:<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:52)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> What is the future of machine-based service certificates which contact outside services,<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:16)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> such as a Rucio server or a Glideinwms factory<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:37)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Google does this with "service accounts" which are quite different from normal access tokens<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:01:58)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Haven't seen the equivalent in the scitokens world at all--seems that only people can request tokens and not machines<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:07)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> It's known as 2-legged OAuth in googlespeak<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:02:24)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I know that FTS knows how to acquire tokens from issuers like IAM.  I don't know all the details though.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:03:38)</span> <b>dschultz:</b></span> I'm not sure what OSG is doing, but there are ways in OAuth to get service account tokens, generally using the Client Credentials grant type<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:21)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Jim Basney posted this into the chat<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(16:07:22)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> here's an example from my notes with Dave:<br/><br/>{<br/>  "wlcg.ver": "1.0",<br/>  "iss": "<a href="https://cilogon.org/fnal/dune">https://cilogon.org/fnal/dune</a>",<br/>  "sub": "<a href="mailto:dunepro@fnal.gov">dunepro@fnal.gov</a>",<br/>  "scope": "storage.read:/store storage.write:/store/data",<br/>  "aud": "<a href="https://wlcg.cern.ch/jwt/v1/any">https://wlcg.cern.ch/jwt/v1/any</a>",<br/>  "nbf": 1595016911,<br/>  "exp": 1595020511,<br/>  "iat": 1595016911,<br/>  "jti": "7abcc281-64f9-48db-a59e-113698dde83a"<br/>}<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(16:13:55)</span> <b>jbasney:</b></span> All are welcome to join the #scitokens channel for follow-up discussions.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:19:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> and #software!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:10)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> &gt;  Haven't seen the equivalent in the scitokens world at all--seems that only people can request tokens and not machines<br/>Just to clarify a bit in case people don't want to drop to the #scitokens channel: in SciTokens, there's no concept of either people or machines.  There's just unique identifiers used for traceability.  My <tt>sub</tt>ject is <tt>27234843-fedf-42c8-bb81-a1695bbd7c28</tt> in the WLCG issuer, for example.<br/><br/>Now the token _issuer_ can have all sorts of policies about who gets what tokens, who's allowed to renew, whether you can have automated renewals, etc, etc.  And that can be part of the rules of the instance of the software - or built in to the token issuer software itself.<br/>

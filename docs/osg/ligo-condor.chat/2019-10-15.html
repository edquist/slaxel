<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:35:06)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @joshua.willis - it struck me this morning that we have a container which starts up an OSG pilot (which is incredibly handy for debugging); as we talk Singularity-related changes, we potentially could do the same thing for LIGO.  This has allowed me to do things like join a development VM to the condor pool and run real jobs.<br/>

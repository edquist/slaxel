<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(09:45:10)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, quick question re GPUs and condor: if i understand correctly, RIFT users are running into problems due to insufficient GPU memory.  They already have <tt>request_memory=4096</tt> but they're introducing a workaround to use <tt>cupy.cuda.Device().mem_info</tt> to check available GPU memory when the job lands.   Surely there is a way to request this already in Condor?   Seems silly that jobs should have to check their own requirements after they've been matched to a machine<br/>

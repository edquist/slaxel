<span style="color: #5870dd"><span style="font-size: small">(05:38:54)</span> <b>duncan.macleod:</b></span> thanks @gthain, is it a fair summary to presume that the history file is not ordered absolutely by any particular attribute?<br/><br/>Context: we have been using the <tt>-since</tt> option to optimise our <tt>condor_history</tt> queries when gathering data for accounting, but it sounds like that is a bad thing to do if you need to get a complete history for a particular set of jobs (say, everything that ran in a UTC day), it seems better to just add the relevant <tt>-constraint</tt> option to give lower and upper boundaries on one of the timing attributes (we use <tt>JobFinishedHookDone</tt>)<br/>

<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(14:52:21)</span> <b>dwd:</b></span> @blin oasis-login runs gsisshd which is a superset of sshd.  Yes .ssh/authorized_keys works.  @duncan.macleod if you have something automated that uploads to ouser.ligo and calls osg-oasis-update, watch out that you don’t clash with anything/anybody else that might also be uploading to the same account at the same time.  Even if you’re working in different subdirectories, it’s possible that somebody else might be in the middle of changing something when osg-oasis-update is run and their changes get partially published.  In practice this is less of a problem with the way we publish to <a href="http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org">oasis.opensciencegrid.org</a> than to other repositories, because the others all need to manually start a transaction and no modifications can be done from the beginning of a publish operation until the start of the next transaction.<br/>

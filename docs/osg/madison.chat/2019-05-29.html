<h3>Wed May 29, 2019 : #madison (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:41)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> mostly @blin and @tim.theisen: until recently (recently = Diego), we've been putting people into the condor:vdt AFS group, which has way too many privileges<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:05)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I added Diego to condor:osgcontributor instead<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> if things work out for him, I want to start removing people from condor:vdt and putting them into condor:osgcontributor (if they still contribute of course)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:39:19)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, i believe we have a jira ticket for it assigned to TimT<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:17)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> also, who do we need to talk to in order to get root/ksu on moria?<br/>

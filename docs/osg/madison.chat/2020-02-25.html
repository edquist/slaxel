<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:37:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> It looks like I’ll need a car (for Monday evening), which means we’ve got two cars to take four people to the airport on the afternoon of March 19 (more comfortable than four people in one car, given bags).<br/>@christinalk @blin, you haven’t gotten cars?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> nope, i figured i'd just take cabs<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:04)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> I was about to say that Carrie is getting in when you are Lauren, but she arrives on Tues, not Mon. :stuck_out_tongue:<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:10)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin I can drive you to the airport from OU! @christinalk I can pick you up Monday night (Sam Gelman of the Gitter Lab gets in the same time!)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:34)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> sweet!<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:40)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> sounds good! @matyas you’re off the hook. :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #db3150"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:54)</span> <b>christinalk:</b></span> just to be clear, are both @matyas and @tim.theisen getting cars in oklahoma?<br/>
<span style="color: #73769d"><span style="font-size: small">(14:34:02)</span> <b>tim.theisen:</b></span> Yes<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(14:51:41)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, did we ever invite @bbockelm to this channel?<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:55:16)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> yeah he's here<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:02)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> he should add his info to the sheet - may see more opportunities for sharing rides.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:15:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> haven't done any bookings yet.  Will add when I know!<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:22:45)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> <b>@channel</b> for the record, the cert issue was indeed on the Tokyo end: they had a conflict between the osg-ca-certs and another CA package.  things were resolved by reinstalling osg-ca-certs and restarting<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:32)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> now filling in the gaps in data from the downtime, so there will be ~7000 files coming shortly<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:46)</span> <b>jlstephen:</b></span> thanks for the heads-up<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:36)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> i have another 9 datasets, mostly about 5k files each @ ~100MB - 1GB per file, i'd like to start replicating to Melbourne.   I'll try to set the internal throttle to 400 active transfers but I assume I should start these 1 at a time and keep an eye on ganglia, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(14:41:10)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> follow up: the australian transfers started failing so I've suspended them until the issue is resolved.   Looks like their storage backend was unmounted during recent maintenance - should be able to resume tuesday<br/>

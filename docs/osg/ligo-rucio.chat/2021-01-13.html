<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:57:12)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i see some failures to hanover --- youâ€™re aware of this (james)<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:30:45)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @paschos, yep. i think there are a couple of problems:<br/> 1. that particular dataset seems to have some access issues and the entire archive is about to be moved to a different filesystem<br/> 2. the hannover gridftp server is ancient and may be struggling with the throughput<br/><br/>I've suspended the rule but that doesn't do anything about the already-submitted jobs.   i just wrote a wee script to loop through and cancel the FTS jobs manually using the rest CLI.<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:31:42)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> My plan is to clear that queue and try again from another RSE  and/or wait until the dataset has been moved to a new filesystem<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:33:03)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> question: does FTS do any kind of automatic throttling on its own?   the rucio throttle is currently set to 100 for both of those transfers, so i'm wondering why it's been sitting at 2 active transfers for so long (it would make a lot of sense to throttle things down if there's a high failure rate like this)<br/>

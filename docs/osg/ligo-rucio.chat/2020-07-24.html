<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(08:36:41)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @gabriele.fronze @paschos we're meeting in ~1 hour, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(08:47:54)</span> <b>gabriele.fronze:</b></span> Hey there! I have another business overlapping today. Sorry about that!<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(09:01:08)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> No problem.  @paschos, i can meet but my updates come to:<br/>1. Dashboards are back up, as you know (after restarting on a different k8s host)<br/>2. I've run into an internal (i.e., not architectural) problem with some data i registered before vacation where it turns out a new file type i was handling have non-unique basenames, causing confusion in the rucio database.  I have a solution (rename/re-register the files and repeat the replication).<br/>3. the Tokyo network is back up but I should fix the database issue before resuming transfers<br/>4. I never got back to you about a time for that presentation next friday, sorry:  any time after 10am EST is ok.<br/>(I've been repairing my bicycle this morning and i'd like to get out to the office shortly - happy to talk if you catch me before i leave or later in the day if that's easier)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:43)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> ok... I'll update the minutes. thanks for the time availability. I'll catch up with you in the afternoon. @gabriele.fronze I have an early tester of your fuse posix access to rucio. if interested we can discuss when available.<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(10:14:47)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hi <b>@channel</b>, i'm trying to get a dataset to Hannover and, once again, i'm seeing a bunch of failures.  Current theory is the checksum is timing out because the throughput is too high, so i'm trying (again) to set the internal throttle.   i'm only seeing 2 active transfers:  have i been throttled on the FTS side?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:24)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> it times out at how many seconds?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(10:15:48)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> when i looked last night it was about 240 s i think<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:52)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> huhâ€¦ that did not hit any internal limits<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:28)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> no fts throttle is in place for you<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(10:59:59)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> yeah, seems to have ticked back up again.  i just enabled the internal throttle, restarted the daemon and suspended the current rule.  i'm trying to actually cancel the submitted jobs and retry to try get this damn throttle working<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:12)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hey, i think i *finally* managed to get the throttle to work - it's now actually checking on the transfer status at least.  it's a technical configuration difference (the docs say you can use the name of an RSE unless you're running in "multi-vo mode" in which case you need the hash of the RSE in the config.  I did not think / was not consscious of running in that mode but that seems to have made a difference)<br/>

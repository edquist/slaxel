<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:32)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi @paschos, can you clarify / remind me what you mentioned about the CNAF &amp; FTS throttling?   I just heard back from Luca, who spoke to local admins, and he was told "they are saying that they did not requested any bandwidth limitation for any fts servers"<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:45)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> they probably donâ€™t remember. cnaf is a storage end point for xenon and there were some issues in the past. @jlstephen might be able to recall the history behind it.<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:22)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> if you want to bring us in an email thread feel free.<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:11)</span> <b>jlstephen:</b></span> this was a couple of years ago at the beginning of when xenon was setting up their tape system<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:21)</span> <b>jlstephen:</b></span> they definitely asked benedikt and me to throttle transfers<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:31)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> <b>@channel</b> heads up that i'm about to set a rule to move a 96480 file dataset to tokyo<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:55)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> (i think they're ~ 10 -- 100 MB each)<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:33)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i don’t support you can chunk it  - do it incrementally ?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:32)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> it should be fine though — judith put in place something to clean the logs automatically if becomes a problem<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:17:56)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> is it a single rule?<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:18:41)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> hmm, in theory i could split it up - it'd mean creating some additional datasets which i'd then have lying around and would want to delete from the database.   in other words, it's possible but the obvious way would probably be quite error-prone<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:31)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> it is a single rule, yes.  at least in the naive approach.  i could split it like i said and set separate rules, then once everything was done, set the single rule and delete the separate rules...<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:36)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> seems pretty clunky, though<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:19:59)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> yeah ok thanks for letting us know —<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:13)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> i just set a rule for a single file to make sure there aren't unexpected failures..<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:32)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> 90k transfer failures would be a big pain<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:20:57)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> agree — fire it up and we’ll watch<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:25)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> test transfer went fine, just set the full rule<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:11)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> so far so good for this<br/>

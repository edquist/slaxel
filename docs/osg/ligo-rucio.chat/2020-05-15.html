<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(15:19:11)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, had some cert issues to resolve but i've tried to dial up the throttle to 400 xfers, per @paschosâ€™s suggestion last week - i still only see 150 active transfers in FTS.   So i'm wondering: is that limit actually imposed by FTS itself?  I'm not entirely convinced the rucio throttle is doing anything<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:26)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> it's set somewhere i wasn't aware --- default settings had it at 400 ...<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:34)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i will look into it<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(15:20:48)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> or we can wait for Judith to come back Monday<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:21)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, are those Xenon FTS jobs taking precedence over everything else right now?  I think i remember @paschos mentioning something like this a while ago but i thought it had already happened?  If so, it's not a big deal (for now), i'm just trying to understand why nothing has happened since about midnight<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:00)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> there shouldn’t be any precedence …<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:48)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> they updated a piece of their infrastructure and transfers that were stopped resumed… i don’t see how this will interefere with ligo --- but checking<br/>
<span style="color: #ea2977"><span style="font-size: small">(12:50:55)</span> <b>jlstephen:</b></span> the fts server's log disk filled up. i am clearing it out<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:24)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> ah got it, thanks!  I just saw the large number of jobs and drew the wrong conclusion<br/>
<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:57)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> and indeed, things are picking up right away now<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:36)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> we did not realize the scale<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:52)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> this doesn’t look right --- we are investigating<br/>

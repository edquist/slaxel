<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:49)</span> <b>gabriele.fronze:</b></span> Hey @paschos sounds good. I have to point out that due to missing gfal2 it is only working on centOS and Debian at the moment. Even on Mac/Ubuntu it won’t work just for that missing dependency :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:07)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> centos is fine. a collaboration is hacking it to access the flat directory structure of rucio and they can benefit from the posix interface. I'll send you an email.<br/>
<span style="color: #5b89d5"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:42)</span> <b>gabriele.fronze:</b></span> Roger that! Gfal2 team has screwed up a bunch of releases and they do not reply to tickets…<br/>

<span style="color: #a2a5dc"><span style="font-size: small">(16:00:14)</span> <b>james.clark:</b></span> Hi <b>@channel</b>, I just had word that KAGRA would like to resume the GEO transfers:  I'm updating the dataset now but i've suspended the rule until it's up-to-date.  Basically, i plan to submit ~16k x 7MB files sometime in the next few days, and will resume the live transfers (which worked out to about 60 submissions every 5 minutes, or so).  I will most likely wait until after the weekend so i'll give you a heads up on monday or tuesday, too.<br/>

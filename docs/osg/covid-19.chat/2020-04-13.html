<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:47:50)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> @rynge Based on your comments in the OSG Factory threads about minimum pilot life, should <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/</a> be updated to include a suggested pilot walltime of 48 hours?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:36)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We will discuss in in a meeting here in a few mintues<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:43)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Still looking at data<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:49:00)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But yeah, I suspect that will be one of the suggested changes<br/>

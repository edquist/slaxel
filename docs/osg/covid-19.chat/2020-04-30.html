<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:03)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> COVID19_Stanford_Das has dropped to nearly no hours today (<a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1</a>). Has anyone checked in with them? Maybe theyâ€™re done with something?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:13)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Still 10k jobs running<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:21)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> They are long<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:08:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> So it might just be that they have not finished very many today<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:24)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Oh, I see. Interesting.<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:52)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> I wonder if they finished one batch of things, then started another, or something like that. Anyway, thanks for checking!<br/>

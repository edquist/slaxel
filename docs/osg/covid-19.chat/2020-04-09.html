<h3>Thu Apr 9, 2020 : #covid-19 (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:20)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge any notable updates form the COVID-19 research side?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> what did we find out about data needs for the Stanford group?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:45)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I pinged both yesterday<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:00:59)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Stanford group has been busy with a paper, but should be ready soon<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:01:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Illinois group has been thinking about the 8-core requirement, but they think they can not come up with a quick way to split it, so we will go ahead with 8 cores for now<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:16)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> how long would a job be if, instead of splitting, they used 4 or 2 cores? (sorry I keep pushing on this, but they could otherwise achieve a new level of scale for their research questions - they may not if they come up against the bottleneck of available 8-core slots; this stuff keeps me up at night.)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:04:54)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks, btw, for the quick response - good information we can report up<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:05:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> <b>@here</b> Also, WeNMR has a discernable blip of usage! <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1</a><br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> nice!<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:11:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup! we verified that their pilots are mostly successful this morning<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:11:35)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i asked them to ramp up to use 10k slots<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:20)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Also, AMNH has a blip of usage as well.  They installed and configured CVMFS this morning.  But yesterday I made a new workflow that ships the Folding@Home container with the job.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:12:40)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ~100Mb is a bit big to scale to a lot of sites, HTTP wouldn't be a bad option for it.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:24:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> FYI, messages coming from on high prioritize a reduced dependence on CVMFS (for data, software modules, container distribution) wherever potentially possible. We cannot broadly engage resources across OSG (without requiring sites like AMNHâ€™s to do OS overhauls and significant technology installations) in supporting COVID-19, otherwise.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:23)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> A grad student associated with Folding@Home may need Gromacs for non-Folding@Home work, and we should look at removing dependency on a software module, maybe distributing a (likely small) container in the same way that Derek did for Folding@Home.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge do any of the other COVID-19 projects currently need CVMFS/software modules/etc.?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:06)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I think Illinois mentioned static binaries, but not sure about Stanford.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:55)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Stanford is a maybe - they will try their binary first by just going general RHEL7. Illinois needs a bunch of Python modules, and will try a venv tarball first<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:21)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> sounds good. Can we test any of that for them, to hand over a solution?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:29:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I have given them test jobs - but they need to put their own codes in there.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:37)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> got it<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:19:52)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @blin @gthain @bbockelm Need some help with (I think) auto clustering and negotiation<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:20:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Derek has a large cluster (~50k) jobs which has specific requirements. He has smaller ones sitting after that one, and in the negotiator, I only see the first one being negotiated<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:20:59)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I can force the smaller ones by changing JobPrio<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:21:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The <tt>AutoClusterId</tt> are different<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(19:22:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I feel like we are hitting some limit between the schedd and negotiator, but I can't figure out which one it is<br/>

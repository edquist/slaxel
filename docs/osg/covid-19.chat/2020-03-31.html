<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(16:04:39)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> Hi, just saw this channel.  I am hoping this is a good place to plug into the technical details on how we can make our cpu and gpu clusters available to covid-19 researchers.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:52:08)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @tiradani Details are being worked out, and should be made available soon<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(16:56:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Weâ€™ll take note to distribute instructions both via email and here. @tiradani, which site are you referring to?<br/>
<span style="color: #9d8eee"><span style="font-size: small">(16:58:58)</span> <b>cat:</b></span> Ah, I thought @tiradani had sent his email to the mailing list, but he did not. Would it help if he re-sent it there, for the record?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(17:03:11)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> I mistakenly left the list off the cc list.  I'll send another with updated information tomorrow.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(17:05:23)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> But to answer your question, pi0 had some gpus, lq1 is mostly cpu.  Both are slurm.  The cms t1 and fermigrid are already open to osg and we will prioritize covid-19 work once we can select on that.<br/>

<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(08:54:51)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> new COVID19 project needs priority turned up, topology entry merged, and any other setup necessary:<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:09:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Have they submitted any jobs?  I think the priority is automatically increased.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:55)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> They will be imminently! This is someone who was around running OSG Connect jobs all along, recently started doing some COVID-19 clinical work, and hadn’t realized we have extra support. It’s someone I’ve engaged with several times, and discovered their new COVID-19 work when I contacted them for a research description for the annual report.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:06)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> He currently has other jobs already queued, under username achapp<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(09:37:56)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Some of his jobs are on hold after running too many times, so they’ll probably benefit from the extra walltime capabilities for COVID19 work.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:42:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> ok, when they submit the jobs with the COVID19 project name, they will automatically get higher priority.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:23:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> @lmichael I got a ticket about this assigned to me - was that on purpose?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> both rutgers and uerj noticed yesterday that they stopped receiving covid-19 jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> is there enough pressure?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Rutgers is weird, factory says there's hundreds of jobs running there, but it's not true...<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(11:25:17)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge I think there’s an automation rule? I created the new ticket, open, assigned to me, type “COVID-19”, and then noticed that it went to you … still not sure why<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:06)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I don't know<br/>

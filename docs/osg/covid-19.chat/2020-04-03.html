<h3>Fri Apr 3, 2020 : #covid-19 (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(08:52:49)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> I think I would like to see if we are setup to run covid19 jobs, I modified routs on <a href="http://ce03.cmssaf.mit.edu">ce03.cmssaf.mit.edu</a> for it<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:00:14)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Hi Max, did you follow the instructions here: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(09:04:24)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> yes, I think I have set it up, Brian and Edgar were helping<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:13:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Great!  Can you send a quick message to <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a> with the CE name, and we will setup the factory entry.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:15:24)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ^^ specifically for that, follow the documentation here: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/#requesting-covid-19-jobs">https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/#requesting-covid-19-jobs</a><br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(17:39:03)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> so any pilots are sent our way by now?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:39:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we're still ramping up on covid payloads right now<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:40:04)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> but if you opened a ticket to request pilots, you should follow up there<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(17:43:26)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> yes, I the reply came at around 11 am that they were putting our CE in, however I do not see anything happening, I wonder if I screwed up something in the setup or need just to wait<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(17:45:42)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> @maxi none of the CEs are getting covid pilots yet except some test pilots, its still being worked on<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:45:46)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you could also always check with <tt>condor_ce_router_q</tt> on the CE<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(17:46:19)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> but we have your entry ready to go in the factory when they do start submitting<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(17:52:45)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> all right, sound sgood, Jeff, do you have a rough time estimate when the load might be arriving?<br/>
<span style="color: #385a86"><span style="font-size: small">(18:01:33)</span> <b>jdost321:</b></span> So far from the factory side we've just been asked to make the entries ready in advance, sorry thats all the info I have. I would expect it all to be sorted out early next week though. Feel free to ping us on the ticket you opened<br/>
<span style="color: #aba727"><span style="font-size: small">(18:05:16)</span> <b>maxi:</b></span> it is all fine, it is ready when it is ready, I was just worried that I screwed up something on my side<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:09:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dweitzel i'm not sure if you have control over this but it's really confusing that the two consumer plots have the exact same colors but reversed: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1&amp;refresh=5m&amp;from=now-2d&amp;to=now">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1&amp;refresh=5m&amp;from=now-2d&amp;to=now</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:09:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> You mean the bar chart and the pie chart?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(18:12:32)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ya<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:15:47)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Ditto<br/>

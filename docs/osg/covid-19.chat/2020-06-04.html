<h3>Thu Jun 4, 2020 : #covid-19 (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:09)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> In the WLCG Ops coordination meeting today the ALICE reports: “10 T2/T3 sites are excluded from F@H jobs as of Sunday afternoon,  because such jobs have started failing a lot at those sites,  while normal ALICE jobs run fine there”  Evidently was failing at a rate that overloaded the central F@H servers?  Have you guys seen any issues there?  CMS reports F@H activity was stable (presumably for example on the CMS HLT farm, etc).<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I'll check output of recent jobs real quick.<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:22)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> I don’t know exactly what was going on — seems ALICE specific.  Maarten Litmaath reported it.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I don't see anything particularly wrong.  Jobs are running at expected walltime (~24 hours), and a sampling of recent jobs seems to show they are receiving work within a few seconds of starting and completing the jobs and uploading the output.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:00)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> While you are looking at jobs, GPU pilots are being requested from our Wilson cluster, but from our end, it looks like nothing matches and the pilots exit after 20 minutes.  The CPU-only pilots are chugging through work with no problems that we can see.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:30)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @tiradani could you send an email to <a href="mailto:osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu">osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu</a> and CC @rynge and myself?<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(10:19:49)</span> <b>tiradani:</b></span> Certainly!  Thanks<br/>

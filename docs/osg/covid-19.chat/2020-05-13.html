<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:52:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do we get return codes of OSG payload records? ATLAS folks brought up the fact that AGLT2 was failing a lot of jobs due to  a misconfigured factory entry that caused pilots to run for only 10 hrs<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:28)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> That's an odd case.  The jobs never "exited" at AGLT2, they were preempted and went somewhere else.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:25)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> argh that's what i was afraid of<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:12)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> do you have any ideas on how we can tease out these "failures"? maybe comparing big gaps between pilot and payload accounting?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:04:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yes, difference in pilot and payload may have shown this issue.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:12:49)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> should we track that internally per site?<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:34)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> so there was no exit code to capture.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:53:51)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> But yes, in general, we do get payload exit codes.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:54:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> We don't often visualize them because exit codes mean different things to different programs.  I think one of the covid workflows Mats is working on is successful if it has one of many non-zero exit code.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:00:46)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, non-zero is expected for that user<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I do get a report from the factory every day though<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:12)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> And I also have logs<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:23)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But did not see this issue<br/>

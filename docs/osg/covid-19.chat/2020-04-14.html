<h3>Tue Apr 14, 2020 : #covid-19 (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(15:45:54)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> Greetings!   We talked a bit about the COVID-19 workflows in the production meeting today &amp; I said I’d throw my question here:  I know there’s a lot of hard work getting these things running in the first place, but when watching these guys go this weekend I saw maybe some room to tune them a bit better --  For example in the pilots I watching — which were 8 core, but then 8 single core FAH jobs within.  Often I saw some of the single jobs waiting for work while others were chugging along inside the same pilot.  Is there a plan to move some of these to multicore?  (also since it sounds like there’s been some creaking in different places handling the large number of single core jobs)<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(15:49:39)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> Also wanted to point out there is a FAH channel on the scienceresponds slack that other sites (I think primarily EGI) have had discussions about how to get this working for them, and I know in CMS there is some effort (from Antonio Yzquierdo) to tame these guys better.<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:51:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yes, the single core jobs in 8 core pilots is not ideal.  It was a quick and easy way to get it going at first.  COVID19 sites are all configured differently and the lowest common denominator was single core.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:52:18)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I need to do a look at the current COVID sites to determine the mix of 8core and other size pilots.<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(15:53:21)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> yeah not criticizing all the work getting this going in the first place!  Just saying once some of that dust settles it looks like there’s some tweaking that’ll help :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:26)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> But also it seems worth touching base with some of these other threads — on scienceresponds one of the site people asked for condor configs which you guys would know without batting an eye :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:54:30)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Yup, agreed.  I also need to add support for GPUs<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(15:56:26)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> yes especially since they weight those higher. :slightly_smiling_face:  And FNAL I think will have some to offer too (maybe already does)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(20:50:15)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> We DO have some research projects that need 8-core jobs. Do the 8-core pilots get divided into single-core slots?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(21:31:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I believe it uses dynamic partitionable slots.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(21:39:27)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Then let’s keep them 8-core. We’ve got a project presumably ramping up, with 8-core jobs<br/>

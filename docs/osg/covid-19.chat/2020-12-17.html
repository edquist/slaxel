<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:04:34)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @blin any idea what happened to WeNMR COVID-19 usage? <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000133/covid-19-research?orgId=1&amp;from=now-90d&amp;to=now">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000133/covid-19-research?orgId=1&amp;from=now-90d&amp;to=now</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:53)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, pilots are sitting idle on the submit host<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:06:28)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> haven't had the time to figure out why they're not matching to any startd's in the OS pool, or why the schedd isn't showing up in flock.osg<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:00)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Are they just done? All of our other COVID-19 projects, except for F@H have wound down. Most are running non-COVID-19 work, still, and some may start up again, but I think we’ve reached a wind-down phase to communicate to sites.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Have we asked WeNMR if they’re still prioritizing COVID-19 work in these jobs, themselves? (I’m not sure what their mechanisms were for deciding which work goes to OSG.)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:07:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> no, they're sending us pilots<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:08:14)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i haven't checked the split but we separate their covid vs non-covid work<br/>

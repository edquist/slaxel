<h3>Thu Apr 16, 2020 : #covid-19 (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #df3dc0"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:03)</span> <b>burt:</b></span> Steven Clark is trying to enable the Rutgers OSG site to run F@H and failing. Maybe someone could reach out?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:54:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I've seen the chat in the Science Responds slack.  It looks like Lukas is helping.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:55:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It looks like he wants to run it manually.  I'm inquiring<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> so the other cores wait around for a max of 8hours?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:24)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @dweitzel is it particularly difficult to add the bin option to the GRACC page for COVID-19?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:50:33)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> not particularly difficult.  Want a binning larger than day?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Binning added.<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(12:55:53)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> can we get by hour bin?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:56:35)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Nope, GRACC summarized data has a 1 day granularity.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:18)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> thanks<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:01)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> anyone have the coordinates for the contact tracing talk?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:04:31)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i don't have access to the science responds slack &gt;.&lt;<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:06:07)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ah nvm it's in the IRIS HEP email<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:04)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> @rynge regarding yesterday’s convo about retirement, why not continue to accept jobs until the 8-core pilot dies? (or, effectively, why not set the retirement lifetime to be closer in length to the pilot lifetime?)<br/>I know that more jobs will be evicted, but more will also be completed versus the current state of unused cores.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:47:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Also, do we know the avg runtime of Folding@home jobs? Is that really a single task (folding) per job, or does a single Folding@home job potentially include multiple folds such that even an evicted job has progressed through some folds?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:22)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I think letting them run until the end just shifts the problem - yes the cores as busy, but if you don't finish you are still thowing away the time used on them<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:34)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The F@H runtime varies<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:42)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Based on the payload<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:57)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Without running any jobs on the cores, we get zero additional throughput. By running something, we WILL get some badput, but we otherwise increase the goodput versus the former.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:19)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/65f88eba2d5b94267ec65123d92e7524">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/65f88eba2d5b94267ec65123d92e7524</a><br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:24)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I’m okay with having more badput, as long as we increase the overall goodput. NOT increasing the overall goodput is a greater waste of resources than some mixed goodput/badput is.<br/>
<span style="color: #bc3663"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:25)</span> <b>dmason:</b></span> actually what you want is a thing that looks to F@H like a big fat client, then somehow pull out send the payloads off into condor as regular jobs :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:49)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Right so it better to use the 8 cores (wider, but shorter)<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:55)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I don’t need perfect, and I don’t want it to stand in the way of ‘better than today’.<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:56:40)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> Perfect for Folding@home is not perfect for the ecosystem of projects and resource variability we’ve got. Plus, 8-core F@home jobs then can’t run on non-8 core slots.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:03)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> We have both 8 core and single core F@H jobs now<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:08)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> At some point, this conversation needs to loop in Brian and Miron, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:15)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Plus other workloads are starting to show up<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:29)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> ^this @rynge<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:43)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> For other jobs with shorter runtimes, we can fill up these waiting-around cores.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:01)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That does happen, up until the retirement time<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:42)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> I thought we had a problem of cores sitting around while the last, single long-job was running? Isn’t that how the conversation started?<br/>
<span style="color: #5a4592"><span style="font-size: small">(13:59:58)</span> <b>lmichael:</b></span> gotta go to a call now<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:00:20)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> That is the general problem, but that is just how pilot jobs work<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:01:18)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> As far as I'm concerned, we have mitigated (or at least minimized) that issue with the 8 core jobs<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:37)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @rynge here's a better link for the average job length: <a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/a60bbb815a47d21f1accf0ff8d9dc811">https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/kibana/goto/a60bbb815a47d21f1accf0ff8d9dc811</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:05:51)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> today, the average folding at home job is 26 hours.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:06:07)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It's still configured to do exactly 1 work unit and exit.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:07)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, that is consistent with what I'm seeing on the submit hosts<br/>

<h3>Thu Jul 29, 2021 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(11:41:20)</span> <b>daues:</b></span> Would this be a channel for discussing responses from xrootd, particularly sysXrdHttp, and security implications?<br/>I am not using xcache per se, but xrootd-server from osg 3.5, 3.6.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(12:22:37)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Questions about configuring xrootd security settings, here or the perhaps the #software channel would probably be a good place to start.<br/>Concerns about about potential security issues should probably go into a ticket, since this slack is open to the world. <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/new">https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/tickets/new</a><br/>
<span style="color: #2b6836"><span style="font-size: small">(13:03:48)</span> <b>daues:</b></span> ok I’ll try a ticket in case it has that ‘potential’; Thanks!<br/>

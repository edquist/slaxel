<h3>Wed Nov 30, 2016 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @lincoln - I still haven't gotten a full scan to complete on <a href="http://cvmfs-stash.osgconnect.net">cvmfs-stash.osgconnect.net</a>.  This time, I ran out of actual disk space :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:24:59)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> sorry, stash-cvmfs<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:05)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> well done<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:25:36)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I'm guessing that it's working on hcc-cvmfs-repo because CVMFS compresses things (and the metadata is stupidly compressible) and we iteratively built up.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:40)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> One question: we saw NOvA jobs running at Caltech yesterday that were reading from the HCC cache. I would have naively thought they would read from UCSD. Is the UCSD cache not fully up and running yet?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Well, the UCSD cache is definitely putting out a bunch of data.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:39:53)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> We should probably ask Matevz or Marian to look at the logs and see if there were more clients from Caltech at Nebraska or at UCSD<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:13)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ah - actually, probably not.  Garhan just took hcc-stash down for repair.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:26)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Running firmware updates, going to replace a bad HDD in the RAID, and bring it up on RHEL7.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Death to RHEL6!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> <a href="https://goo.gl/90iDwj">https://goo.gl/90iDwj</a><br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:42:49)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Looks like UCSD was doing a lot.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:43:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> More than Nebraska, fwiw.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:46:56)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> so should I dig for something in the logs at UCSD or we wait until hcc-stash is back and see how things go?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:48:42)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @kherner Were all the jobs at Caltech reading from Nebraska?  Or some small fraction?  If most went to UCSD, that would be fine.  If it becomes overloaded and unresponsive, I would hope CVMFS would move on to another site (HCC is the second closest)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:18:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @bbockelm for that host list above, would you randomly query them until you got a response?  Or would you go in that order?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:20)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> which host list?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> The GeoIP list above for CVMFS<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Randomly query until you get a response.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:37:43)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (Although you can ignore BNL because they haven't installed the application...)<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:12:58)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Not sure if it was all Caltech jobs or just some<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:13:32)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> It must have been a fair amount to Nebraska though because CPU efficiency was somewhat low<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:26:02)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> yeah - between a degraded RAID and lots of Syracuse clients, hcc-stash wasn't having a great day.<br/>

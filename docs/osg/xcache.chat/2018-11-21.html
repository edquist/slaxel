<h3>Wed Nov 21, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:32)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @matyas @blin - John, Derek, and I have reserved a conference room and are going to hack on XCache tickets today.  First ones up are:<br/>- <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/pull/472">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/pull/472</a><br/>- SOFTWARE-3444<br/>- SOFTWARE-3468<br/>- SOFTWARE-3469<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:40:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> mat's out for thanksgiving<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:11:00)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Gotcha.  So we'll hopefully not have overlapping work.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(22:23:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ok, at the end of the day, we have a programmatic way to implement Authfile generation within the topology application.  We'll need to update/release StashCache-Daemon and xrootd-lcmaps in order to get this full thing working, however.  It should cut down the complexity of the Kubernetes-based deploy as one no longer needs to configure LCMAPS or a <tt>ligo</tt> user.<br/>

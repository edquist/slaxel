<h3>Mon Oct 22, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(04:03:42)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ^ that sounds right, @matyas... in the stashcache world we actually can see only origins as Srv, nothing in the StashCache Federation except top level redirector uses manager role, that's why ... I discussed quite long time ago possibility see the caches in the xrdmapc as something optional and I think I've got replies it should be possible and we can request it as new feature ... I'll look at old emails and reopen the discussion ...<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:20:01)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> hi @jthiltges, I saw you made a bunch of StashCache-Daemon changes since I tagged v0.9<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:21:40)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> do you think those changes are ready for prime time? if so, we might update our build of it<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(14:28:15)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Hi @matyas. We've been running with those changes (multiprocessing, plus some minor systemd timer tweaks) for about 12 days. Seems OK so far!<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:32:34)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Are there any other changes you'd like to get in before v0.10? Also it's probably you or @marian that should update the specfile (version, changelog) and tag it since it's not really my project<br/>

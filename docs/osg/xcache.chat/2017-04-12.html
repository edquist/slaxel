<h3>Wed Apr 12, 2017 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:19)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I can see the Mu2e and Microboone StashCache repos now. Many thanks @dweitzel!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(11:53:13)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Awesome!  Let me know if you have any problems. <br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:15:55)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> We had a mu2e user add things a few minutes ago. The sync is set for every 30 minutes, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:16:35)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I want to set his expectations correctly :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:44:44)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Sure, 30 minutes.  It's a bit variable.  I can tell you a few things.<br/>1. The sync script is run, then sleeps for 15 minutes, then runs again, then sleeps for 15 minutes.  The sync script could run for longer periods if there are lots of files, or large files, to checksum.<br/>2. There are caches all over the place.  The authoritative CVMFS server is updated every 15 minutes.  Then it's cached in squid caches, and finally the nodes.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:45:36)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> So, in short, too much variability to say exactly 30 minutes.  But if it's more than an hour for a file to show up, I would be surprised.<br/>

<h3>Fri Jul 5, 2019 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:28:40)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @efajardo how far along did you get? the problem with using <tt>config.d</tt> is that the current xcache <tt>config.d</tt> is intended for use by the stash cache and stash origin<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:29:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i had worked on fixing it so that the <tt>xcache</tt> config.d could serve as the base for stash cache, cms xcache, and atlas xcache<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:30:17)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i have to double-check where i last left off but i think i was pretty close and you should be able to base your work off the new layout<br/>

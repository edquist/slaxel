<h3>Tue Apr 6, 2021 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:14)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> Hi Folks, I heard a talk from Andrew H. today about xrootd network oriented features. Starting from 5.x it provdes data in motion integrity and protects each block requested by crc32c checksum and corrected on the fly. Does it mean clients/servers must be 5.x? or can client be on 4.x? I assume all must be 5.x, but just want to double check<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(15:03:35)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> That would solve long standing issue I face day to day â€¦ Users complaining that jobs failing and file is just corrupt on cache<br/>

<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:09:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I _think_ that both have to 5.x.  I don't know if that is turned on by default either, it may have to be "enabled"?  Did Andy mention that?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(15:10:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Also, you can enable TLS between the origin and the cache, which will also guarantee integrity on the cache.  Well, it won't protect against corruption at rest, but it will protect in transit.<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:36:50)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @justas.balcas - checksum doesn't correct on the fly.  There's also data at rest to think of.<br/>
<span style="color: #de5f24"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:03)</span> <b>justas.balcas:</b></span> maybe I missed something from this slide then<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:08:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> ah, I stand corrected.  Didn't think that part was done yet!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:09:03)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Glad to hear.  I thought it was a 5.2 thing.<br/>

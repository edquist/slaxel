<h3>Fri Nov 9, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:57:49)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> I was thinking we might want to explicitly separate public data from private data (so users are fully aware of what parts of their data are public. So for example have <tt>/chtc/public</tt> and have unauthed caches only provide _that_, whereas <tt>/chtc/&lt;anythingelse&gt;</tt> would require auth.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:58:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> Does that sound like a good idea?<br/>

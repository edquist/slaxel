<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(22:22:05)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> What ports does xrootd need open?<br/>I have a deployment behind a port-forwarding NAT, and just opening the configured port (31094 in my case) does not seem to be enough<br/>xrdfs blocks forever<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(22:22:40)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> From another node that does not have to go through a firewall xrdfs instead works just fine<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(23:00:04)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> typical port usage of xrootd defaults to 1094, if that helps ... also, depends what you're setting up, is it cache, origin, redirector (requires cmsd process besides xrootd)?<br/>

<h3>Tue Sep 3, 2019 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(15:17:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> what's the difference between "missing directory" and "unknown directory" in the kibana dashboard? (and what can we do to get rid of them?)<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:48:40)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> unknown directory = Not FNAL, CMS, OSG-Connect Stash, chtc, icecube... directory.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:50:08)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> missing directory = we don't know the directory at all.  Just that something was "read/write"<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:53:11)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> how does that happen? it seems to be the majority<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(16:54:32)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> at least for last week<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(20:27:15)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> It looks like it's coming from CMS sites a lot.  It seems normal that they send a lot of "close" messages.  We haven't tracked down why xrootd is sending all these file close messages without corresponding open messages.<br/>

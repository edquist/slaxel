<h3>Thu Oct 25, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(10:37:27)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> when copying from stashcache via cvmfs, how does cvmfs know which cache to use? does it still use the geoip stuff?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:36)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> @dweitzel are we having a meeting today?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yup.  Just putting together the agenda now.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:59)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> it will likely be a short meeting.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:48:27)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> yes, CVMFS uses GeoIP.  Stashcp borrows the GeoIP servers from CVMFS actually.  GeoIP is built-into  CVMFS.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:39)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Thanks @dweitzel for running meeting. I was pretty much packed by other meetings with CMS folks at CERN, just now got to the hotel. Talk to you next week...<br/>

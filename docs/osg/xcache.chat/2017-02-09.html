<h3>Thu Feb 9, 2017 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:38)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> So I'm working on getting some people to actually use the DES stash over CVMFS instance now<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:38)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I put a few new files in, and while I see them in FNAL dCache, they don't show up when I do an ls of the same area going through cvmfs. I assume there's some update that needs to happen but it looks like that's not automatic. Can someone remind me where it's controlled?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:08:56)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> it's controlled at Nebraska, but we only whitelist a few directories for sync.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:34)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @bbockelm the sync is recursive, right?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:45)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> and how often does it happen?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:15)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> As far as I can tell, it is not automatic.  But it is recursive.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:27:32)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> currently, it is indexing the dir: <a href="root://stashcache.fnal.gov//pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/des/persistent/stash">root://stashcache.fnal.gov//pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/des/persistent/stash</a><br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:00)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> @dweitzel  Thanks, yes, that's the right one. So what's the procedure for requesting a sync?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:28:27)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I can kick off a sync.  And I could write a service auto sync periodically.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:22)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> sync'd.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:31)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> CVMFS takes a bit for all the layers of cache to update.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:57)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> That would be great when you get a chance. You can probably hold off on the sync at the moment since I need to talk with a user to make sure he gets his stuff in there properly (it's a few tens of GB, so we might as well wait until it's done to sync.)<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:40)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Thanks again. I'd guess every 15 minutes or every 30 minutes would be good in this case, unless you think that's too frequent<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:30:57)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> 30 minutes seems very reasonable.<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:01:16)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> All right for now I think. I hae another meeting now so I can't make it to StashCache now<br/>

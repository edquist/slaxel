<h3>Tue Oct 2, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:24)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hey, how goes all things StashCache today?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:17:46)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Mat, what’s the status of your servers?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:54)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @marian Opened a PR to maybe improve the StashCache authfiles: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/StashCache-Daemon/pull/11/files">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/StashCache-Daemon/pull/11/files</a><br/>@bbockelm I think Mat's out this week?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:33:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, Mat is out whole week ... my PR may need some additions maybe, but should be better then it was before<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:42:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> hmm, can't find my PR for the docs part... @jthiltges, do you see it? Btw, maybe we should then make what's shipped in Authfile part of the docs directly and explain there, too ... /shrug<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:03)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> @marian Ah, I hadn't noticed it before: <a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/pull/446">https://github.com/opensciencegrid/docs/pull/446</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:38)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yep, that's the one, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:48:47)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> in docs...<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(12:07:47)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Are there plans for a second authenticated-only StashCache user (beyond LIGO)? That would probably make the example more useful.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(12:10:31)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> For example: authenticated ligo can see ligo, but not glow. Authenticated glow can see glow, but not ligo. Others can see neither.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:36)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:48)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> don't know we have such cache case<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(12:25:52)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> probably not atm<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:46:47)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yeah, we are starting to pick up interest from CMS to share the infrastructure, as well as Simons Foundation, Wisconsin and a few others.  Hence the need to shore this up...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:47:43)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Would be nice if we got the Wisconsin example working so we can better cover the N&gt;1 case<br/>

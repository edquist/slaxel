<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:13:14)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @matyas @jthiltges - the ridiculous part here is that the code is configured to skip the LCMAPS callout itself but still initializes LCMAPS.  We should indeed have a better default for <tt>xrootd-lcmaps</tt>, but we can also just skip initialization for John's use case.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:09)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Would it be too silly to ship placeholder config files for /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile and /etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile in the lcmaps package?<br/>It's already providing /etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile and /etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:22)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> probably not a bad idea.<br/>

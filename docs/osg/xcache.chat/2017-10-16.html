<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:34:49)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @lincoln - we did a lot of merging and improvements to the <a href="http://stash.osgstorage.org">stash.osgstorage.org</a> repo last week... I don't know if it's related, but the Stash origin server seems to be a lot faster now...<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:35:35)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Still haven't done the Xrootd work required to pass through xattrs, which would allow us to take advantage of the recursive mtime ... we'll get there.<br/>

<h3>Tue Sep 18, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(20:06:15)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Hi folks - I need to schedule a meeting such that I either miss the first half or second half of the stashcache meeting on Thursday.  Which would be better?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(21:13:01)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> Maybe be present first half and you disconnect when you need to? Also half would be ideally between 15-30mins max, last time we had meeting ~35mins....<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(21:43:08)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> gotcha.  I'll sign up for the later meeting then.  Thanks<br/>

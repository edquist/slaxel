<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:12:39)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> does xrdcp automatically use a grid proxy/voms proxy if it exists? the manpage doesn't list any command line arguments or environment variables for setting it<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(09:14:55)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i believe that's the case<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(09:50:13)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> is Nebraska hosting the LIGO origin? can someone give me the path for a file in /user/ligo that CNAF can use as a test file?<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(09:53:36)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Under <tt>/user/ligo/test_access/</tt><br/>- access_dev (This file is meant to be accessible by authenticated developers who aren't in LIGO.)<br/>- access_ligo (This file is meant to be accessible to LIGO members only.)<br/>- access_unauth (This file is meant to be accessible by unauthenticated users.)<br/>- simulated_20MB_file (20MB of something random looking)<br/>- simulated_file (382MB of something random looking)<br/>I'm not 100% certain though. Hopefully someone can correct me!<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:03)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Sounds about right<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:40:15)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> Is there a way to tell one stashcache to fetch content not yet in its own cache from another closeby cache, instead of going all the way to the origin?<br/>One example: We have 2 caches in europe, both serving mostly US based origins<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(17:41:27)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i think that's what cms does with redirectors<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(17:42:44)</span> <b>isfiligoi:</b></span> I thought redirectors were just there to point a client to a cache that has the file, not for routing where cache itself fetches the data from.<br/>Can someone else confirm, either way?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(18:47:32)</span> <b>paschos:</b></span> i have the same question actually<br/>

<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:52:03)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> I should probably know the answer to this...<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:53:48)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Some DES users have a large (~50 GB) file that will go into StashCache soon, but they usually chunk it in some way. I'm not exactly sure what their mechanism is for doing that (seekg, etc.) but would that for some reason something like that would break on a StashCache file? I think it's fine but there are people here that would know better...<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:16)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Where "chunk it" really means "read only part of it in each job."<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:00)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> StashCache reads in files in "chunks" from CVMFS.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:12)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I think those chunks are something like 24MB's in the current configuration.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:42)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> So it doesn't really matter if DES chunks things themselves, or just puts the whole 50GB file in StashCache.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:57:54)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> if they only read parts of the file, then only parts of the file will be downloaded to the node, as needed.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:58:06)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> does that make sense?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:03)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Yep, thanks<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(11:06:10)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> So they'll be none the wiser<br/>

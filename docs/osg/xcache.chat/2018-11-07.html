<h3>Wed Nov 7, 2018 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:26:05)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Yo @lincoln @efajardo - @jthiltges is going to be poking around on doing a more production-y k8s at Nebraska.  The target would be to (eventually) have a k8s-based <tt>hcc-stash</tt>.<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(11:27:05)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> How do I get started? There's a github repo somewhere?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> afaik, re k8s and StashCache any updates should go here: <a href="https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/STAS-44">https://opensciencegrid.atlassian.net/browse/STAS-44</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:28:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I'd defer to @lincoln on whether we want deploy directly on k8s like Edgar is doing or whether we want to do a full-blown SLATE setup.<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:30:07)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> as of last StashCache meeting @efajardo mentioned merged version is in the dockerhub account of opensciencegrid, somewhere ... and will update STAS-44 ticket<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:31:06)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/opensciencegrid/prp-stashcache/">https://hub.docker.com/r/opensciencegrid/prp-stashcache/</a> this one?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:41)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'd guess so!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:32:50)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (don't suppose we can rename it to <tt>stashcache</tt>?)<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:39:15)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> Hi. If you have a k8s cluster you can install the SLATE client and register with us, or you can install Helm and use our application catalog a la carte<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:44:57)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> (fun game - compare the differences in recommended configs between the SLATE version of StashCache, PRP version of StashCache, OSG version of StashCache, and generic OSG Xrootd documents)<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:04)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:45:22)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> why have one way to do <tt>sec.protocol</tt> when you can do 4?<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:46:36)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> yeah i'd love to get things consolidated :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:47:38)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> i would stress that our Stashcache deployment is only minimally tested right now. anyhow happy to chat if you're interested in using Helm and/or SLATE<br/>
<span style="color: #e96699"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:02)</span> <b>lincoln:</b></span> <a href="https://sandbox.slateci.io:5000/">https://sandbox.slateci.io:5000/</a> we have a prototype-y demo sandbox that you can try to deploy k8s applications the "SLATE way"<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(11:49:48)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> since we have identified critical crashing bugs in all released versions of Xrootd, maybe we should think about taking advantage of the new-style 4.9 configs?<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:16)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> I just copied configs written by other people to make the SLATE version, so I make no claims about whether they are actually good; input from experts would be much appreciated.<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(11:52:55)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> Is 4.9 a new, soon to be released version, which would both support a new config style and not have (known) crashing bugs?<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:29:07)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> 4.9 ... well, when I first started asking, it was supposed to be released in September.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(12:32:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Given where we are in the year and the typical release candidate cycle ... is January "soon to be released"?<br/>
<span style="color: #e85d72"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:28)</span> <b>cnweaver:</b></span> I guess it would be possible to start developing an updated chart against the trunk, although we would have to wait until it is released to put it in the SLATE catalog.<br/>

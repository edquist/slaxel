<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(09:36:05)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> I suppose we should upgrade to the v5.1 rc builds.<br/>There were some hdfs plugin checksum path issues with v5.0. We'd upgraded to the v5.0.4 CI build to test Andy's fix.<br/><a href="https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/1331">https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/1331</a><br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:17:35)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> @mtadel, is there something specific to worry about also for the redirectors if they run v5? I guess not since managers don't host any data, but just in case you know of something let us know... I run  always latest stable release from xrootd for example on CMS global redirectors as well as transitional redirectors... those hosts have nothing to do with caches, though, but now I'm curious...<br/>
<span style="color: #dd8527"><span style="font-size: small">(10:54:27)</span> <b>mtadel:</b></span> Thanks! @jthiltges . I don't know if this went into 5.1.0-rc4. @marian, no, nothing to worry about for the redirectors, those have been stable for a long time now<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(10:56:16)</span> <b>jthiltges:</b></span> Looks like the fix (6143f87) made it into v5.1.0-rc1 and beyond. :tada:<br/>

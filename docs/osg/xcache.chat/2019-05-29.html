<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:47:25)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Anything looking fishy as far as StashCache goes in the past day or so?<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(14:48:05)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> Both DES and Minerva are seeing problems reading files. FNAL dCache looks OK as far as the source goes, so I'm just working my way down the chain to debug it now<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:43)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> Mats has also reported weirdness.  Nothing that we can single out as the problem though.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:57:52)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> any debugging information you have done would be useful.<br/>

<h3>Sat Apr 30, 2016 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:38:16)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> sorry - I had to run out on Friday (candidate came in for an interview).<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:29)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I did get quite a few improvements done to the sync script.  I’m _thisclose_ to just changing it to a systemd service<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:42:26)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> also switched everything to python generators (<tt>yield</tt> statement) so transfers could start while I’m still spidering the directory structure.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:18:27)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> :confused: the transfer rates still stink… does <tt><a href="http://data.ci-connect.net">data.ci-connect.net</a></tt> have overlayfs?  I’m thinking maybe we should run this process there.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:31:18)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I dropped a pubkey in <tt>/home/bbockelm/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</tt> on <tt>login01</tt>.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(14:54:54)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> … and then transfer rates shot up.  Weird.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:02:11)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Is it possible directories are tied to different hardware?  The improved rates suspiciously match when <tt>/user/rynge</tt> was being processed.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:34)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> hm - you know what would be better than <tt><a href="http://data.ci-connect.net">data.ci-connect.net</a></tt> being the CVMFS repo?  If xrootd could just return the checksum format needed by CVMFS.<br/>

<h3>Mon Feb 4, 2019 : #xcache (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:36:40)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> <b>@here</b> ... are we going to rename this channel to "xcache" or just create new one to be more generic for more broad decision making within "xcache" project rather than osg-stashcache project. Or even better, shall we create <a href="http://xcache.slack.com">xcache.slack.com</a> and sub-create appropriate channels: generic, osg-stashcache, atlas-xcache, cms-xcache...? ... thoughts?<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:36)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> I agree with different channel or renaming<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:39)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> but definetly<br/>
<span style="color: #a63024"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:47)</span> <b>efajardo:</b></span> would avoid a second slack<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:37:47)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> let's not make a new slack, please<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:39)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> i dunno if it would be better to rename this channel or make a new #xcache and tell people to go there<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:40:57)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> i vote just a rename<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:41:09)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, I'm on 6 slacks, I bet some people are on more (BrianB :)), there are pros and cons of having things separate ... let's see more opinions and we will do one way or another ... I'd like we discuss on Thursday meeting and finally decide<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:42:50)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> If I get a vote, a renaming is best<br/>
<span style="color: #8d4b84"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:19)</span> <b>kherner:</b></span> After renaming, one could even make a new channel with the old name that just had a message saying, "go to the xcache channel now."<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:43:28)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> if we just rename we tend to talk about osg-stashcache in xcache afterwards ... that I don't want ... I see opportunity start to separate things a bit as the xcache project is about be an umbrella for -any-cache projects based on xrootd<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:50)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> let's hear from atlas and cms folks, too ... it should pull in more cache specific discussions in the future we dont' want to intermix imho<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:44:53)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> i'm not convinced we have enough traffic to justify creating yet another slack instance<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:20)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> additionally i don't think we have enough traffic to justify creating another channel<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:24)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> well, last week example I think shows a case we'd need to soon<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:45:58)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> last week doesn't seem too much to me<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:16)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I scrolled through discussion and saw many things more generic than pure osg-stashcache example, for example<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:24)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> fine so rename it #xcache<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:46:44)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> ok, let's bring it to Thursday discussion ... thanks for feedback so far<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:48:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> my metric is, do conversations frequently get confusing because multiple people are asking different questions at the same time?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:51:26)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yeah, plus channel topic unrelated but still relevant for another type of discussion upstream<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:52:03)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that doesn't always justify separating out into channels/different slacks, people just need to respond in slack threading when appropriate<br/>
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:06)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> imo slack threading sucks... it's easy to miss that a thread got forked off<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:21)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, agreed<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> you get notified of responses to threads you participate in<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:54:59)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> it works for most short conversations without polluting the main channel<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:00)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> the ui still needs some work imo<br/>plus sometimes you don't know ahead of time which conversation would be short<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:37)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> that's a fair point<br/>
</blockquote>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:53:22)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> we should be start distinguishing more operation vs application related<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:55:45)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> stash cache ops -&gt; #osg-ops<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:57:35)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's just stashcache ops ... not cms, atlas... I personally see opportunity for better breakdown of things<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:26)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> ATLAS/CMS ops probably have their own (not slack) channels to discuss their operational issues<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:43)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> not for caches<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(13:58:49)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> afaik<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:02:25)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> I'm talking about "XCache" as its meaning was established for a reason ...  e.g. stashcache is just OSG usage of XCache ... we should do better in terms of creating brand here<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(14:03:18)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> that's why question to the channel gather feedback from most plus discuss on the next meeting then<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:07:52)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> like I said, ok with renaming it #xcache. after that, if atlas, cms, ops folks, developers, etc. feel that they are being left out or that most of the discussion is unimportant to them, they can make #xcache-cms, #xcache-atlas, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:08:43)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> anybody can create a channel, we don't have to create it for them<br/>
<span style="color: #c386df"><span style="font-size: small">(14:09:21)</span> <b>matyas:</b></span> which means that we can have 'late-binding' for channels<br/>

<span style="color: #7d414c"><span style="font-size: small">(08:52:51)</span> <b>bockjoo:</b></span> Elena from CNAF needs your xrootd redirector expertise. Her level 1 redirector (ipv6 part) shows port number 0 instead of 1094 at xrdmapc --listall &lt;cms global redirector&gt; | grep cnaf. ipv4 shows the correct 1094 number, though. Can somebody give her direction?<br/>
<span style="color: #53b759"><span style="font-size: small">(10:18:32)</span> <b>marian:</b></span> yes, I'm on the case and responded ... I doubt they need to do anything about xrd.port or something on the similar note they asked ... also, there is intermix of issue she reports, one is problem with their subscription of new servers which they put under DNS alias (wrong) and other is problem with regional redirector under the EU DNS alias <a href="http://xrootd-cms.infn.it">xrootd-cms.infn.it</a> ... I commented to the hypernews thread as well as to the GGUS ticket.<br/>

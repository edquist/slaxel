<h3>Fri May 6, 2016 : #documentation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:49)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> hey all, whenever you see this, do y’all have thoughts on a documentation lifecycle mechanism? I made a rudimentary tool that would tell the goc to look over certain documents a year after they’re entered into the system, but I feel like there’s a better way to do this and I’m just not finding it or seeing it<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:19)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Oof.  No insight there.  I think user support team has looked at the idea of “testable docs” - various code-samples that could be validated every night.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:40)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> ok, well I have a thing that I’ve tested and works<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:28:57)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @elizabethprout @dweitzel: Here’s a webpage that took the RtD template for mkdocs and added collapsible navigation; <a href="http://helpmonks.github.io/docs/">http://helpmonks.github.io/docs/</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:25)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/588">https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/588</a> linked from this issue<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:29:27)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> yeah that’s something I can work with<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(15:30:27)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> I have also have an inventory of every web and I’m looking through to identify ownership<br/>

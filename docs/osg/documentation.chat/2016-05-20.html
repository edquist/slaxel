<h3>Fri May 20, 2016 : #documentation (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:38:37)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> @elizabethprout: do you have an agenda for the docs meeting?  Or, are we mostly in the _design_ phase?<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:26)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> I only have a few things to talk about personally and they’re on the agenda:<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:39:47)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> 1) stuff from last week (webs, goc testing the software)<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:40:04)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> 2) document lifecycle software plans<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:40:23)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> do you want me to add something?<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:40:53)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> nope, just wondering if there is more detailed agenda.  That is fine.<br/>
<span style="color: #235e5b"><span style="font-size: small">(08:41:17)</span> <b>dweitzel:</b></span> I’m not sure if Brian will join us, he flew back from Madison late last night, and if I were him, I would take the day off.<br/>
<span style="color: #4cc091"><span style="font-size: small">(08:43:56)</span> <b>elizabethprout:</b></span> Okay, that’s cool. Yeah it may be lightly attended and short this week because of condor week. The main goal for me is to make some sort of progress on the lifecycle this week. It’s a crucial feature for preventing cruft.<br/>

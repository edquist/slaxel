<h3>Wed May 8, 2019 : #scitokens (osg)</h3>
<span style="color: #8f4a2b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:05)</span> <b>dabrown:</b></span> @bbockelm bump on the file transfer plugins for checkpointing. I’ll be back from travel on Monday and my grad student is ready to try a workflow out using scitokens to store checkpoints on our big new xrootd server.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:22:30)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> I have a nice long flight tomorrow and that’s on my list!<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(13:27:20)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Where are you this week anyway?<br/>
<span style="color: #8f4a2b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:20)</span> <b>dabrown:</b></span> I’m spending the summer at UC Santa Barbara and I’m driving the car down so it’s there when the family join me. Right now, I’m in the Subaru dealer in Flagstaff waiting for them to replace my windshield that was smashed by a Colorado thunderstorm!<br/>
<span style="color: #8f4a2b"><span style="font-size: small">(14:12:39)</span> <b>dabrown:</b></span> Let me know when the plugins are ready to test, thanks!<br/>

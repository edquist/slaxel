<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:34:50)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @timm - <tt>gfal-ls <a href="https://foo.example.com">https://foo.example.com</a></tt> is probably what you want for the first question.  Older versions of GFAL had better luck when you used the <tt>davs://</tt> prefix (since directory listing is technically an WebDAV extension) but I believe modern versions default to WebDAV for HTTPS listing.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:35:34)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> For 3.6: simply install a CE, tokens are on by default.  I would recommend that you maybe try out @rynge’s CE at ISI if you just want to submit some jobs.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:05:57)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Ok.  There’s absolutely no mention of tokens in any of the docs right now<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(10:10:36)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @blin ^^^ Steve, we have a monthly documentation afternoon and I know 3.6 changes have been a hot topic.  Could you drop a friendly email we can turn into a JIRA ticket on what would be useful to mention?<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:12:16)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yeah, i think we'll be in a much better spot with the next 8.9/9.0 release + docs from condor<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:12:52)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> on the CE side, i'm hoping that honestly we won't need much documentation for SCITOKENS and that things are mostly resolved through default config/packaging<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:22:19)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> I can drop friendly email now but to what address?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:26:22)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> I have no doubt that the actual software will work--all I have tested is working already--but I am just dreading having to go to every site in Europe and beg them to take my token.. Starting the process with CERN right now and not getting very far.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:00)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> So what I need to know is how to add extra signers, etc, how to map particular token ids to special users, etc.<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:22)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> basically all the hackery that we had to do for x.509 that will also be necessary on the token side.<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:27:54)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> yup, that's in the plan<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:06)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> shoot an email to <a href="mailto:software-discuss@opensciencegrid.org">software-discuss@opensciencegrid.org</a><br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(10:28:39)</span> <b>blin:</b></span> we can give some guidance if it's pressing but it's going to be a lot easier with the next version of condor/condor-ce<br/>

<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @dweitzel - fwiw, we do say in the verification docs "we currently rely on the use of the “key ID” attribute to determine the public key associated with the token".  It's not part of the JWT RFC, but it's an integral way that SciTokens work.<br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(09:23:45)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> we probably have some friendly fallback code in the Python implementation which would be useful to not rely on for too much longer.<br/>

Basically, that's only a problem if you are using a JWT library directly (also, it's a really old attack ... most JWT libraries have protection against that these days) and not using the SciTokens library.  Basically, you should not trust the algorithm specified in the header.  SciTokens doesn't allow you to use an HMAC-based verification at all because it doesn't fit with the model.<br/>

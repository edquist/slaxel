<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:02:28)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> Nicolas Liampotis had some slides that point at this: <a href="https://github.com/stfc/pam_oauth2_device">https://github.com/stfc/pam_oauth2_device</a><br/>
<span style="color: #9e3997"><span style="font-size: small">(08:03:39)</span> <b>bbockelm:</b></span> @jbasney - that reminds me, it's been at least a week since I've bugged you about the device code flow :wink:<br/>
<span style="color: #e06b56"><span style="font-size: small">(08:06:26)</span> <b>jbasney:</b></span> Jeff showed me a proof-of-concept device code flow implementation in the SciTokens Java issuer last week. It's not going in to our CILogon March update, but I think it's likely to be in our CILogon April update.<br/>

<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(14:13:02)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Is there any way to do a listing of a directory on a SE using the https interface?  if so, how?<br/>
<span style="color: #50a0cf"><span style="font-size: small">(19:56:44)</span> <b>timm:</b></span> Also is there any documentation for how to configure a token-accepting htcondor-ce using osg 3.6?  I have looked all through <a href="http://opensciencegrid.org">opensciencegrid.org</a> documentation and htcondor-ce documentation, and don't see it.  Better yet does anyone already have one up that we can try to hit?<br/>

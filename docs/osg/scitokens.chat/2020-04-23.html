<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:14:38)</span> <b>jpatton:</b></span> @dweitzel I'm still not sure why the credmon is hanging, but (as I sigh after we just fixed something similar on the condor side) those log messages do all come from the oauth part of the credmon, which really shouldn't be doing anything with these files<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:15:19)</span> <b>jpatton:</b></span> and so I'm trying to think of a strategy to keep the oauth credmon from looking at locally issued tokens (and the local credmon from looking at oauth issued tokens)<br/>
<span style="color: #43761b"><span style="font-size: small">(16:15:50)</span> <b>jpatton:</b></span> I think we can rely on the fact that the webserver drops the metadata file in the oauth case<br/>

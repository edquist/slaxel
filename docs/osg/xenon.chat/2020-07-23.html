<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(10:55:07)</span> <b>ershockley:</b></span> Could we present an update on this at Team A meeting next week maybe?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:21)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I can't do next week as we have the PEARC'20 conference<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:26)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> I can do the week after<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:00:51)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> (or you can talk about it without me - no problem for me)<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:03)</span> <b>ershockley:</b></span> Ah yes of course. Might be better to have you there, so we can do next week but maybe advertise things earlier<br/>
<span style="color: #99a949"><span style="font-size: small">(12:33:38)</span> <b>ershockley:</b></span> @diego.ramirez have you been able to try running with it on OSG? Or do you need the tutorial for an example?<br/>

<span style="color: #d55aef"><span style="font-size: small">(01:47:44)</span> <b>diego.ramirez:</b></span> Ugh. I had done exactly that, but wrote <tt>--ltbb</tt> instead of <tt>-ltbb</tt> . Sorry :disappointed:<br/>
<span style="color: #d55aef"><span style="font-size: small">(05:51:33)</span> <b>diego.ramirez:</b></span> I ran some tests and things look good. @l.alth Did you give it a try?<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(12:49:32)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> The new image is uploaded - it is really minor changes, but you should not see that RPM warning anymore<br/>
<span style="color: #d55aef"><span style="font-size: small">(12:58:21)</span> <b>diego.ramirez:</b></span> Infinite thanks, Mats! I'll keep testing and we can probably start advertising the container at the end of the week. I guess Lutz will also join me on that.<br/>
<span style="color: #d55aef"><span style="font-size: small">(12:59:12)</span> <b>diego.ramirez:</b></span> Minor questions will follow, I guess. Now I can think about one: how will we always keep this image updated with respect to the main base_environment? I guess we have to.<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:44)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> Yeah, you just have to rebuild your container if you want to pick up something new from base_environment<br/>
<span style="color: #674b1b"><span style="font-size: small">(13:19:50)</span> <b>rynge:</b></span> But it has been pretty stable<br/>
